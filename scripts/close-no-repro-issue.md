To align with our new [Open Governance](https://remix.run/blog/rr-governance) model, we are now requiring that all issues have a [**minimal** and **runnable** reproduction](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#bugissue-process). This should help us to focus on actionable issues and be more responsive to newly filed issues.

To get this re-opened, please add a reproduction to the Issue description and tag `@brophdawg11` or `@brookslybrand` in a comment so we can re-open.

Or, if this was closed by mistake and there is a valid reproduction, please ensure that it is linked in the Issue description and and tag `@brophdawg11` or `@brookslybrand` in a comment so we can re-open.

If you have any questions, you can always reach out on [Discord](https://rmx.as/discord). Thanks again for providing feedback and helping us make React Router even better!
