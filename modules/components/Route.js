/**
 * <Route> components specify components that are rendered to the page when the
 * URL matches a given pattern.
 *
 * Routes are arranged in a nested tree structure. When a new URL is requested,
 * the tree is searched depth-first to find a route whose path matches the URL.
 * When one is found, all routes in the tree that lead to it are considered
 * "active" and their components are rendered into the DOM, nested in the same
 * order as they are in the tree.
 *
 * The preferred way to configure a router is using JSX. The XML-like syntax is
 * a great way to visualize how routes are laid out in an application.
 *
 *   var routes = [
 *     <Route handler={App}>
 *       <Route name="login" handler={Login}/>
 *       <Route name="logout" handler={Logout}/>
 *       <Route name="about" handler={About}/>
 *     </Route>
 *   ];
 *   
 *   Router.run(routes, function (Handler) {
 *     React.render(<Handler/>, document.body);
 *   });
 *
 * Handlers for Route components that contain children can render their active
 * child route using a <RouteHandler> element.
 *
 *   var App = React.createClass({
 *     render: function () {
 *       return (
 *         <div class="application">
 *           <RouteHandler/>
 *         </div>
 *       );
 *     }
 *   });
 *
 * If no handler is provided for the route, it will render a matched child route.
