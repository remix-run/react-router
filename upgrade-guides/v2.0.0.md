# v2.0.0 Upgrade Guide

## Notes

### Goals

1. Clear up the coupling between History and Router with sipler APIs.

2. Provide cleaner integrations with other libraries like Redux, Relay, Async Props etc.

3. Stop providing API that conceals usage of `context`. It is now a documented feature of React so developers using Router can implement their own opinions on how best to use context: Mixins, higher-order components, decorators, etc. React Router no longer has an opinion, but instead uses the lowest level feature of React.  This project wants to be an incredibly useful routing library and doesn't want to get hung up on best-practice patterns for getting stuff from up top to down low.

For more information see [https://github.com/rackt/react-router/issues/2646]

For a lot of apps this upgrade will be API churn. Underneath the hood there are significant differences that make integrating with the rest of the React ecosystem more straightforward. It's hard to imagine the top-level API changing much after this. But if it does, rest assured we are committed to ...

### Backwards Compatibility and Deprecation Warnings

This has been a community project from the start, we need your help making the upgrade as smooth as possible for everybody!

We have done our best to provide backwards compatibility with deprecated APIs. If you drop in v2.x into a v1.x application and it doesn't run, then there is a bug. Please open an issue when you discover what the problem is so we can get a fix out.

The deprecation warnings should also lead you to the relevant part of this document. If one doesn't, please open a pull request with a fix. Also, if any part of this document could be improved, please let us know how. Confound it, our bias is often inescapable!

## New Router render prop (`RoutingContext` prop replacement)

You can now pass a `render` prop to `Router` for it to use for rendering. This allows you to create "middleware components" that participate in routing. Its critical for integrations with libraries like Relay, Redux, Resolver, Transmit, Async Props, etc.

```js
// the default is basically this:
<Router render={props => <RouterContext {...props}/>}/>
```

`RoutingContext` was undocumented and therefore has no backwards compatibility.

## Changes to provided context and Mixins

Only an object named `router` is added to context. Accessing `context.history`, `context.location`, and `context.route` are all deprecated.

Additionally, since `context` is now documented, all mixins are deprecated as they simply served to conceal usage of context.

### Accessing location

Access `location` from `this.props.location` of your route component. If
you'd like to get it deeper in the tree, you can use whatever
conventions your app has for getting props from high down low. One
option is to put it context yourself:

```js
// v1.0.x
const RouteComponent = React.createClass({
  childContextTypes: {
    location: React.PropTypes.object
  },

  getChildContext() {
    return { location: this.props.location }
  }
})
```

## History Mixin
(see below)

## Route component `history` prop
(see below)

## `context.history`
(see below)

## Programatic Navigation

There were several ways to get a hold of the history object to navigate around (see above :P) 1.0. In 2.0, where you once had a `history`, you now have a `router` to navigate instead (only from context) with a better signature.

```js
// v1.0.x
history.pushState(state, path, query)
history.replaceState(state, path, query)

// v2.0.0
router.push(path)
router.push({ pathname, query, state }) // new "location descriptor"

router.replace(path)
router.replace({ pathname, query, state }) // new "location descriptor"
```

### Navigating in Route Components

```js
// v1.0.x
class RouteComponent extends React.Component {
  someHandler() {
    this.props.history.pushState(...)
  }
}

// v2.0.0
class RouteComponent extends React.Component {
  contextTypes: {
    router: object.isRequired
  },

  someHandler() {
    this.context.router.push(...)
  }
}
```

## Navigating inside deeply nested components

```js
// v1.0.x
const DeepComponent = React.createClass({
  mixins: [ History ],

  someHandler() {
    this.history.pushState(...)
  }
}

// v2.0.0
// You have a couple options:
// 1) Use context.router
const DeepComponent = React.createClass({
  contextTypes: {
    router: object.isRequired
  },
  someHandler() {
    this.context.router.push(...)
  }
}

// 2) Use the singleton history you are using when the router was rendered,
import { browserHistory } from 'react-router'
const DeepComponent = React.createClass({
  someHandler() {
    browserHistory.push(...)
  }
}
```

## Lifecycle Mixin

```js
// v1.0.x
const RouteComponent = React.createClass({
  mixins: [ Lifecycle ],
  routerWillLeave() {
    // ...
  }
})

// v2.0.0
const RouteComponent = React.createClass({
  contextTypes: {
    router: object.isRequired
  },
  componentDidMount() {
    const { route } = this.props
    const { router } = this.context
    router.setRouteLeaveHook(route, this.routerWillLeave)
  }
})
```

You don't need to manually tear down the route leave hook in most cases. We automatically remove all attached route leave hooks after leaving the associated route.

## Links `to` Type

`<Link to>` can now take a location descriptor in addition to strings. The `query` and `state` props are deprecated.

```js
// v1.0.x
<Link to="/foo" query={{ the: 'query' }}/>

// v2.0.0
<Link to={{ pathname: '/foo', query: { the: 'query' } }}/>

// Still valid in 2.x
<Link to="/foo"/>
```

For custom link-like components, the same applies for `router.isActive`, previously `history.isActive`.

```js
// v1.0.x
router.isActive(pathname, query, indexOnly)

// v2.0.0
router.isActive({ pathname, query }, indexOnly)
```

## `RoutingContext` renamed to `RouterContext`

```js
// v1.0.x
import { RoutingContext } from 'react-router'
// v2.0.0
import { RouterContext } from 'react-router'
```
