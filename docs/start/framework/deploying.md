# Deploying

[MODES: framework]

## Introduction

React Router can be deployed two ways:

- Fullstack Hosting
- Static Hosting

To get the most benefits from React and React Router, we recommend fullstack hosting.

## Fullstack Hosting

You can get the most out of React and React Router by deploying to a fullstack hosting provider.

### Manual Fullstack Deployment

If you want to deploy to your own server or a different hosting provider, see the [Manual Deployment](../how-to/manual-deployment) guide.

## Static Hosting

React Router doesn't require a server and can run on any static hosting provider.

### Popular Static Hosting Providers

You can get started with the following Deploy Now buttons:

[![Deploy SPA Cloudflare][cloudflare_button]][cloudflare_spa]

[![Deploy Netlify SPA][netlify_button]][netlify_spa]

[![Deploy Vercel SPA][vercel_button]][vercel_spa]

### Manual Static Hosting

Ensure the `ssr` flag is `false` in your Vite config:

```ts
import react from "@react-router/dev/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react({ ssr: false })],
});
```

Build the app:

```shellscript
npx vite build
```

And then deploy the `build/client` folder to any static host.

You'll need to ensure that all requests are routed to `index.html`. This is different with every host/server, so you'll need to find out how with your host/server.
