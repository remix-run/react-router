# Installation

[MODES: framework]

## Introduction

Most projects start with a template. Let's use a basic template maintained by React Router:

```shellscript nonumber
npx create-react-router@latest my-react-router-app
```

Now change into the new directory and start the app

```shellscript nonumber
cd my-react-router-app
npm i
npm run dev
```

You can now open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

You can [view the template on GitHub][default-template] to see how to manually set up your project.

We also have a number of [ready to deploy templates][react-router-templates] available for you to get started with:

```shellscript nonumber
npx create-react-router@latest --template remix-run/react-router-templates/<template-name>
```
