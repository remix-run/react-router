# Form

[MODES: framework, data]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation â†—](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.Form.html)

A progressively enhanced HTML [`<form>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) that submits data to actions via `fetch`, activating pending states in `useNavigation` which enables advanced user interfaces beyond a basic HTML form. After a form's action completes, all data on the page is automatically revalidated to keep the UI in sync with the data.

Because it uses the HTML form API, server rendered pages are interactive at a basic level before JavaScript loads. Instead of React Router managing the submission, the browser manages the submission as well as the pending states (like the spinning favicon). After JavaScript loads, React Router takes over enabling web application user experiences.

Form is most useful for submissions that should also change the URL or otherwise add an entry to the browser history stack. For forms that shouldn't manipulate the browser history stack, use [`<fetcher.Form>`][fetcher_form].

```tsx
import { Form } from "react-router";

function NewEvent() {
  return (
    <Form action="/events" method="post">
      <input name="title" type="text" />
      <input name="description" type="text" />
    </Form>
  );
}
```

## Props

### action

[modes: framework, data]

The URL to submit the form data to. If `undefined`, this defaults to the closest route in context.

### discover

[modes: framework, data]

Determines application manifest discovery behavior.

### encType

[modes: framework, data]

The encoding type to use for the form submission.

### fetcherKey

[modes: framework, data]

Indicates a specific fetcherKey to use when using `navigate={false}` so you
can pick up the fetcher's state in a different component in a [useFetcher](../hooks/useFetcher).

### method

[modes: framework, data]

The HTTP verb to use when the form is submitted. Supports "get", "post",
"put", "delete", and "patch".

Native `<form>` only supports `get` and `post`, avoid the other verbs if
you'd like to support progressive enhancement

### navigate

[modes: framework, data]

Skips the navigation and uses a [useFetcher](../hooks/useFetcher) internally
when `false`. This is essentially a shorthand for `useFetcher()` +
`<fetcher.Form>` where you don't care about the resulting data in this
component.

### onSubmit

[modes: framework, data]

A function to call when the form is submitted. If you call
`event.preventDefault()` then this form will not do anything.

### preventScrollReset

[modes: framework, data]

Prevent the scroll position from resetting to the top of the viewport on
completion of the navigation when using the <ScrollRestoration> component

### relative

[modes: framework, data]

Determines whether the form action is relative to the route hierarchy or
the pathname. Use this if you want to opt out of navigating the route
hierarchy and want to instead route based on /-delimited URL segments

### reloadDocument

[modes: framework, data]

Forces a full document navigation instead of client side routing + data
fetch.

### replace

[modes: framework, data]

Replaces the current entry in the browser history stack when the form
navigates. Use this if you don't want the user to be able to click "back"
to the page with the form on it.

### state

[modes: framework, data]

State object to add to the history stack entry for this navigation

### viewTransition

[modes: framework, data]

Enables a [View
Transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API)
for this navigation. To apply specific styles during the transition see
[useViewTransitionState](../hooks/useViewTransitionState).
