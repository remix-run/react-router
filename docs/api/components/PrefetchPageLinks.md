# PrefetchPageLinks

[MODES: framework]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation â†—](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.PrefetchPageLinks.html)

Renders `<link rel=prefetch|modulepreload>` tags for modules and data of another page to enable an instant navigation to that page. `<Link prefetch>` uses this internally, but you can render it to prefetch a page for any other reason.

```tsx
import { PrefetchPageLinks } from "react-router";

<PrefetchPageLinks page="/absolute/path" />;
```

For example, you may render one of this as the user types into a search field to prefetch search results before they click through to their selection.
