# Scripts

[MODES: framework]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation â†—](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.Scripts.html)

Renders the client runtime of your app. It should be rendered inside the `<body>` of the document.

```tsx
import { Scripts } from "react-router";

export default function Root() {
  return (
    <html>
      <head />
      <body>
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

If server rendering, you can omit `<Scripts/>` and the app will work as a traditional web app without JavaScript, relying solely on HTML and browser behaviors.

## Props

### ScriptsProps

[modes: framework]

A couple common attributes:

- `<Scripts crossOrigin>` for hosting your static assets on a different server than your app.
- `<Scripts nonce>` to support a [content security policy for scripts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src) with [nonce-sources](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/Sources#sources) for your `<script>` tags.

You cannot pass through attributes such as `async`, `defer`, `src`, `type`, `noModule` because they are managed by React Router internally.
