[MODES: framework, data, declarative]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.Route.html)

Configures an element to render when a pattern matches the current location.
It must be rendered within a [`Routes`](../components/Routes) element. Note that these routes
do not participate in data loading, actions, code splitting, or any other
route module features.

```tsx
// Usually used in a declarative router
function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route index element={<StepOne />} />
        <Route path="step-2" element={<StepTwo />} />
        <Route path="step-3" element={<StepThree />} />
      </Routes>
   </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

// But can be used with a data router as well if you prefer the JSX notation
const routes = createRoutesFromElements(
  <>
    <Route index loader={step1Loader} Component={StepOne} />
    <Route path="step-2" loader={step2Loader} Component={StepTwo} />
    <Route path="step-3" loader={step3Loader} Component={StepThree} />
  </>
);

const router = createBrowserRouter(routes);

function App() {
  return <RouterProvider router={router} />;
}
```
