# Router

[MODES: declarative]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation â†—](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.Router.html)

Provides location context for the rest of the app.

Note: You usually won't render a `<Router>` directly. Instead, you'll render a
router that is more specific to your environment such as a `<BrowserRouter>`
in web browsers or a `<StaticRouter>` for server rendering.
