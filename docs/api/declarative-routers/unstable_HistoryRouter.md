# HistoryRouter

[MODES: declarative]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation â†—](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.unstable_HistoryRouter.html)

A `<Router>` that accepts a pre-instantiated history object. It's important
to note that using your own history object is highly discouraged and may add
two versions of the history library to your bundles unless you use the same
version of the history library that React Router uses internally.
