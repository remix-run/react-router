## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.unstable_HistoryRouter.html)

A declarative [`<Router>`](../declarative-routers/Router) that accepts a pre-instantiated
`history` object.
It's important to note that using your own `history` object is highly discouraged
and may add two versions of the `history` library to your bundles unless you use
the same version of the `history` library that React Router uses internally.

## Signature

```tsx
function HistoryRouter({ basename, children, history }: HistoryRouterProps)
```

## Props

### basename

Application basename

### children

``<Route>`` components describing your route configuration

### history

A `History` implementation for use by the router
