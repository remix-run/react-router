Public Modules
--------------

All modules found at the repository root are considered public. You can
require them conveniently with `var Route = require('react-router/Route');` etc.

Note that we do not support requiring modules from our `modules`
directory. (No notes in the changelog, no changes to the versioning of
the lib, etc.)
