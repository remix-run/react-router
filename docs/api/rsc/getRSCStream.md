```tsx
import { startTransition, StrictMode } from "react";
import { hydrateRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import {
  unstable_getRSCStream as getRSCStream,
  unstable_RSCHydratedRouter as RSCHydratedRouter,
} from "react-router";
import type { unstable_RSCPayload as RSCPayload } from "react-router";

createFromReadableStream(getRSCStream()).then(
  (payload: RSCServerPayload) => {
    startTransition(async () => {
      hydrateRoot(
        document,
        <StrictMode>
          <RSCHydratedRouter {...props} />
        </StrictMode>,
        {
          // Options
        }
      );
    });
  }
);
```
