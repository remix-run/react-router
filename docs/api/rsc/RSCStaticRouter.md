Pre-renders an [`unstable_RSCPayload`](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/types/react_router.unstable_RSCPayload.html) to HTML. Usually used in
[`unstable_routeRSCServerRequest`](../rsc/routeRSCServerRequest)'s `renderHTML` callback.

```tsx
import { createFromReadableStream } from "@vitejs/plugin-rsc/ssr";
import * as ReactDomServer from "react-dom/server.edge";
import {
  unstable_RSCStaticRouter as RSCStaticRouter,
  unstable_routeRSCServerRequest as routeRSCServerRequest,
} from "react-router";

routeRSCServerRequest({
  request,
  fetchServer,
  createFromReadableStream,
  async renderHTML(getPayload) {
    const payload = await getPayload();

    return await renderHTMLToReadableStream(
      <RSCStaticRouter getPayload={getPayload} />,
      {
        bootstrapScriptContent,
        formState: await getFormState(payload),
      }
    );
  },
});
```
