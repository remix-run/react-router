# Future Flags and Deprecations

This guide walks you through the process of adopting future flags in your React Router app. By following this strategy, you will be able to upgrade to the next major version of React Router with minimal changes. To read more about future flags see [API Development Strategy](../community/api-development-strategy).

We highly recommend you make a commit after each step and ship it instead of doing everything all at once. Most flags can be adopted in any order, with exceptions noted below.

<docs-warning>**There are no current future flags in React Router v7**</docs-warning>
