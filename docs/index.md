# React Router Home

React Router is a multi-strategy router for React bridging the gap from React 18 to React 19. You can use it maximally as a React framework or as minimally as you want.

## Getting Started

There are three primary ways, or "modes", to use it in your app, so there are three guides to get you started.

- [Declarative](./start/declarative/installation)
- [Data](./start/data/custom)
- [Framework](./start/framework/installation)

Learn which mode is right for you in [Picking a Mode](./start/modes).

## Using These Guides

Across the docs you'll see the following icons:

[MODES: framework, data, declarative]

<p></p>

These icons indicate which mode the content is relevant to.

Additional auto-generated reference documentation is available:

## Upgrading

If you are caught up on future flags, upgrading from React Router v6 or Remix v2 is generally non-breaking. Remix v2 apps are encouraged to upgrade to React Router v7.

- [Upgrade from v6](./upgrading/v6)
- [Upgrade from Remix](./upgrading/remix)
