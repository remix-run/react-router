# Special Files

There are a few special files that React Router looks for in your project. Not all of these files are required

## react-router.config.ts

The config file is used to configure certain aspects of your app, such as whether you are using server-side rendering, where certain directories are located, and more.

```tsx filename=react-router.config.ts
import type { Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";

export default {
  // Config options...
} satisfies Config;
```

See the [react-router.config.ts API documentation](../api/framework-conventions/react-router.config.ts) for complete configuration options.

## `root.tsx`

The "root" route (`app/root.tsx`) is the only _required_ route in your React Router application because it is the parent to all routes in your `routes/` directory and is in charge of rendering the root `<html>` document.

```tsx filename=app/root.tsx
import { Links, Meta, Outlet, Scripts } from "react-router";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <Meta />
        <Links />
      </head>
      <body>
        <Outlet />
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

See the [root.tsx API documentation](../api/framework-conventions/root) for complete details including Layout exports and advanced usage.

## `routes.ts`

The `routes.ts` file is used to configure which url patterns are matched to which route modules.

```tsx filename=app/routes.ts
import {
  type RouteConfig,
  route,
} from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
  route("some/path", "./some/file.tsx"),
  // pattern ^           ^ module file
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

See the [routes.ts API documentation](../api/framework-conventions/routes) and the [routing guide][routing] for more information.

## `entry.client.tsx`

By default, React Router will handle hydrating your app on the client for you. The `entry.client.tsx` file is the entry point for the browser and is responsible for hydrating the markup generated by the server.

```tsx filename=app/entry.client.tsx
import { startTransition, StrictMode } from "react";
import { hydrateRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { HydratedRouter } from "react-router/dom";

startTransition(() => {
  hydrateRoot(
    document,
    <StrictMode>
      <HydratedRouter />
    </StrictMode>
  );
});
```

See the [entry.client.tsx API documentation](../api/framework-conventions/entry.client) for complete details.

## `entry.server.tsx`

By default, React Router will handle generating the HTTP Response for you. The `entry.server.tsx` file lets you create the response, including HTTP status, headers, and HTML, giving you full control over the way the markup is generated and sent to the client.

```tsx filename=app/entry.server.tsx
import { renderToString } from "react-dom/server";
import { ServerRouter } from "react-router";

export default function handleRequest(
  request: Request,
  responseStatusCode: number,
  responseHeaders: Headers,
  routerContext: EntryContext
) {
  const markup = renderToString(
    <ServerRouter
      context={routerContext}
      url={request.url}
    />
  );

  return new Response("<!DOCTYPE html>" + markup, {
    status: responseStatusCode,
    headers: responseHeaders,
  });
}
```

See the [entry.server.tsx API documentation](../api/framework-conventions/entry.server) for complete details including streaming, error handling, and data request handling.

## `.server` modules

While not strictly necessary, `.server` modules are a good way to explicitly mark entire modules as server-only.
The build will fail if any code in a `.server` file or `.server` directory accidentally ends up in the client module graph.

```txt
app
â”œâ”€â”€ .server ðŸ‘ˆ marks all files in this directory as server-only
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ db.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ cms.server.ts ðŸ‘ˆ marks this file as server-only
â”œâ”€â”€ root.tsx
â””â”€â”€ routes.ts
```

`.server` modules must be within your app directory.

Refer to the Route Module section in the sidebar for more information.

## `.client` modules

While uncommon, you may have a file or dependency that uses module side effects in the browser. You can use `*.client.ts` on file names or nest files within `.client` directories to force them out of server bundles.

```ts filename=feature-check.client.ts
// this would break the server
export const supportsVibrationAPI =
  "vibrate" in window.navigator;
```

Note that values exported from this module will all be `undefined` on the server, so the only places to use them are in [`useEffect`][use_effect] and user events like click handlers.

```ts
import { supportsVibrationAPI } from "./feature-check.client.ts";

console.log(supportsVibrationAPI);
// server: undefined
// client: true | false
```
