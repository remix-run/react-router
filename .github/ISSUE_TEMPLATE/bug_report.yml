        Thank you for helping to improve React Router!

        - **All** bugs must have a **minimal** reproduction
          - Minimal means that it is not just pointing to a deployed site or a branch in your existing application
          - The preferred method is StackBlitz via [https://reactrouter.com/new](https://reactrouter.com/new)
          - If Stackblitz is not an option, a GitHub repo based on a fresh `create-react-router` app is acceptable
          - Only in extraordinary circumstances will code snippets or maximal reproductions be accepted
        - Issue Review
          - Issues not meeting the above criteria will be closed and pointed to this document
          - Non-issues (feature requests, usage questions) will also be closed with a link to this document
          - The SC will triage issues regularly
        - Fixing Issues
          - The SC will mark good community issues with an `Accepting PRs` label
          - These issues will generally be ones that are likely to have a small surface area fix
          - However, anyone can work on any issue but there's no guarantee the PR will be accepted if the surface area is too large for expedient review by a core team member

        ## Option 1: Submit a PR with a failing test

        üèÜ The most helpful reproduction is to use our _bug report integration test_ template:

        1. [Fork `remix-run/react-router`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/fork)
        2. Open [`integration/bug-report-test.ts`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/dev/integration/bug-report-test.ts) in your editor
        3. Follow the instructions and submit a pull request with a failing bug report test!

        ## Option 2: Continue filling out this form

        If you'd rather open a GitHub issue, here are other ways to share a reproduction (ordered from most helpful to least):

        - ü•á Link to a [StackBlitz](https://reactrouter.com/new) environment
        - ü•à Link to a GitHub repository
        - ü•â Description of project including template, config files, `package.json` scripts, etc.
