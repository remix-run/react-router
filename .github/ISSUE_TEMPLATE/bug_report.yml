        Thank you for helping to improve React Router!

        Please note that **all** bugs must have a **minimal** and **runnable** reproduction, meaning that it is not just pointing to a deployed site or a branch in your existing application, or showing a small code snippet. For more information, please refer to the [Bug/Issue Process Guidelines](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#bugissue-process).

        ## If you are using **Framework Mode**, you have 2 preferred options

        ### Option 1 - Create a failing integration test

        üèÜ The most helpful reproduction is to use our _bug report integration test_ template:

        1. [Fork `remix-run/react-router`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/fork)
        2. Open [`integration/bug-report-test.ts`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/dev/integration/bug-report-test.ts) in your editor
        3. Follow the instructions to create a failing bug report test
        4. Link to your forked branch with the failing test in this issue

        ### Option 2 - Create a **minimal** reproduction

        - ü•á Link to a [StackBlitz](https://reactrouter.com/new) environment
        - ü•à Link to a GitHub repository containing a minimal reproduction app

        ## If you are using **Data** or **Declarative Mode**

        Create a **minimal** reproduction

        - ü•á Link to a CodeSandbox repro: [TS](https://codesandbox.io/templates/react-vite-ts) | [JS](https://codesandbox.io/templates/react-vite)
        - ü•à Link to a GitHub repository containing a minimal reproduction app
