React Router is a lightweight, fully-featured routing library for the [React](https://reactjs.org) JavaScript library. React Router runs everywhere that React runs; on the web, on the server (using node.js), and on React Native.

If you're reading this, you're on the dev branch where we are actively developing the next major version of React Router, version 6. We're really excited about v6 and believe it delivers a lot of improvements over v5, but we do not yet recommend it for use in production. Please wait until we have a stable release before deploying it on your production app.

If you're new to React Router, we recommend you start with [the getting started guide](/docs/installation/getting-started.md).

If you're migrating to v6 from v5 (or v4, which is the same as v5), check out [the migration guide](/docs/advanced-guides/migrating-5-to-6.md).

When v6 is stable we will publish the docs on our website.
