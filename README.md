React Router is a lightweight, fully-featured routing library for the [React](https://reactjs.org) JavaScript library. React Router runs everywhere that React runs; on the web, on the server (using node.js), and on React Native.

If you're new to React Router, we recommend you start with [the tutorial](/docs/start/tutorial.md).

If you're migrating to v6 from v5 (or v4, which is the same as v5), check out [the migration guide](/docs/upgrading/v5.md). If you're migrating from Reach Router, check out [the migration guide for Reach Router](/docs/upgrading/reach.md). If you need to find the code for v5, [it is on the `v5` branch](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/v5).

When v6 is stable we will publish the docs on our website.
