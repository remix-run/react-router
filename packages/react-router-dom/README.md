# react-router-dom

DOM bindings for [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router).

## Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    $ npm install --save react-router-dom@next

Then with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), use as you would anything else:

```js
// using ES6 modules
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom'

// using CommonJS modules
var BrowserRouter = require('react-router-dom').BrowserRouter
var Route = require('react-router-dom').Route
var Link = require('react-router-dom').Link
```

The UMD build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-router-dom@next/umd/react-router-dom.min.js"></script>
```

You can find the library on `window.ReactRouterDOM`.
