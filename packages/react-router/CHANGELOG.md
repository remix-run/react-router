# `react-router`

## 6.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Preserve state from `initialEntries` ([#9288](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9288))
- Updated dependencies:
  - `@remix-run/router@1.0.1`

## 6.4.0

Whoa this is a big one! `6.4.0` brings all the data loading and mutation APIs over from Remix. Here's a quick high level overview, but it's recommended you go check out the [docs][rr-docs], especially the [feature overview][rr-feature-overview] and the [tutorial][rr-tutorial].

**New APIs**

- Create your router with `createMemoryRouter`
- Render your router with `<RouterProvider>`
- Load data with a Route `loader` and mutate with a Route `action`
- Handle errors with Route `errorElement`
- Defer non-critical data with `defer` and `Await`

**Bug Fixes**

- Path resolution is now trailing slash agnostic (#8861)
- `useLocation` returns the scoped location inside a `<Routes location>` component (#9094)

**Updated Dependencies**

- `@remix-run/router@1.0.0`
