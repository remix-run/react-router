# Static Routes

Previous versions of React Router used static routes to configure your application's routing. This allows for inspection and matching of routes before rendering.  Since v4 moved to dynamic components instead of route configs, some previous use-cases became less obvious and tricky.

We are developing a package to work with static route configs and React Router, to continue to meet those use-cases. It is under development now but we'd love for you to try it out and help out.
