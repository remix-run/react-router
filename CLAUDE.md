# React Router Project Instructions

## Session Start

**REQUIRED**: Read [./AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) at the start of every session. It contains:

- Project architecture and key files
- React Router modes (Declarative, Data, Framework, RSC)
- Build/test commands (Jest unit tests, Playwright integration tests with `--project chromium`)
- Testing patterns and conventions
- Documentation guidelines

## During Work

**Always consult AGENTS.md** when you need to:

- Run tests or builds
- Understand which mode(s) a feature applies to
- Find key file locations
- Understand testing patterns

Do not guess at commands - reference AGENTS.md for the correct syntax.
