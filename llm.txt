# Sessions and Cookies

## Sessions

Sessions are an important part of websites that allow the server to identify requests coming from the same person, especially when it comes to server-side form validation or when JavaScript is not on the page. Sessions are a fundamental building block of many sites that let users "log in", including social, e-commerce, business, and educational websites.

When using React Router as your framework, sessions are managed on a per-route basis (rather than something like express middleware) in your `loader` and `action` methods using a "session storage" object (that implements the [`SessionStorage`][session-storage] interface). Session storage understands how to parse and generate cookies, and how to store session data in a database or filesystem.

### Using Sessions

This is an example of a cookie session storage:

```ts filename=app/sessions.server.ts
import { createCookieSessionStorage } from "react-router";

type SessionData = {
  userId: string;
};

type SessionFlashData = {
  error: string;
};

const { getSession, commitSession, destroySession } =
  createCookieSessionStorage<SessionData, SessionFlashData>(
    {
      // a Cookie from `createCookie` or the CookieOptions to create one
      cookie: {
        name: "__session",

        // all of these are optional
        domain: "reactrouter.com",
        // Expires can also be set (although maxAge overrides it when used in combination).
        // Note that this method is NOT recommended as `new Date` creates only one date on each server deployment, not a dynamic date in the future!
        //
        // expires: new Date(Date.now() + 60_000),
        httpOnly: true,
        maxAge: 60,
        path: "/",
        sameSite: "lax",
        secrets: ["s3cret1"],
        secure: true,
      },
    }
  );

export { getSession, commitSession, destroySession };
```

We recommend setting up your session storage object in `app/sessions.server.ts` so all routes that need to access session data can import from the same spot.

The input/output to a session storage object are HTTP cookies. `getSession()` retrieves the current session from the incoming request's `Cookie` header, and `commitSession()`/`destroySession()` provide the `Set-Cookie` header for the outgoing response.

You'll use methods to get access to sessions in your `loader` and `action` functions.

After retrieving a session with `getSession`, the returned session object has a handful of methods and properties:

```tsx
export async function action({
  request,
}: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const session = await getSession(
    request.headers.get("Cookie")
  );
  session.get("foo");
  session.has("bar");
  // etc.
}
```

See the [Session API][session-api] for more all the methods available on the session object.

### Login form example

A login form might look something like this:

```tsx filename=app/routes/login.tsx lines=[4-7,12-14,16,22,25,33-35,46,51,56,61]
import { data, redirect } from "react-router";
import type { Route } from "./+types/login";

import {
  getSession,
  commitSession,
} from "../sessions.server";

export async function loader({
  request,
}: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const session = await getSession(
    request.headers.get("Cookie")
  );

  if (session.has("userId")) {
    // Redirect to the home page if they are already signed in.
    return redirect("/");
  }

  return data(
    { error: session.get("error") },
    {
      headers: {
        "Set-Cookie": await commitSession(session),
      },
    }
  );
}

export async function action({
  request,
}: Route.ActionArgs) {
  const session = await getSession(
    request.headers.get("Cookie")
  );
  const form = await request.formData();
  const username = form.get("username");
  const password = form.get("password");

  const userId = await validateCredentials(
    username,
    password
  );

  if (userId == null) {
    session.flash("error", "Invalid username/password");

    // Redirect back to the login page with errors.
    return redirect("/login", {
      headers: {
        "Set-Cookie": await commitSession(session),
      },
    });
  }

  session.set("userId", userId);

  // Login succeeded, send them to the home page.
  return redirect("/", {
    headers: {
      "Set-Cookie": await commitSession(session),
    },
  });
}

export default function Login({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  const { error } = loaderData;

  return (
    <div>
      {error ? <div className="error">{error}</div> : null}
      <form method="POST">
        <div>
          <p>Please sign in</p>
        </div>
        <label>
          Username: <input type="text" name="username" />
        </label>
        <label>
          Password:{" "}
          <input type="password" name="password" />
        </label>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

And then a logout form might look something like this:

```tsx filename=app/routes/logout.tsx
import {
  getSession,
  destroySession,
} from "../sessions.server";
import type { Route } from "./+types/logout";

export async function action({
  request,
}: Route.ActionArgs) {
  const session = await getSession(
    request.headers.get("Cookie")
  );
  return redirect("/login", {
    headers: {
      "Set-Cookie": await destroySession(session),
    },
  });
}

export default function LogoutRoute() {
  return (
    <>
      <p>Are you sure you want to log out?</p>
      <Form method="post">
        <button>Logout</button>
      </Form>
      <Link to="/">Never mind</Link>
    </>
  );
}
```

<docs-warning>It's important that you logout (or perform any mutation for that matter) in an `action` and not a `loader`. Otherwise you open your users to [Cross-Site Request Forgery][csrf] attacks.</docs-warning>

### Session Gotchas

Because of nested routes, multiple loaders can be called to construct a single page. When using `session.flash()` or `session.unset()`, you need to be sure no other loaders in the request are going to want to read that, otherwise you'll get race conditions. Typically if you're using flash, you'll want to have a single loader read it, if another loader wants a flash message, use a different key for that loader.

### Creating custom session storage

React Router makes it easy to store sessions in your own database if needed. The [`createSessionStorage()`][create-session-storage] API requires a `cookie` (for options for creating a cookie, see [cookies][cookies]) and a set of create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) methods for managing the session data. The cookie is used to persist the session ID.

- `createData` will be called from `commitSession` on the initial session creation when no session ID exists in the cookie
- `readData` will be called from `getSession` when a session ID exists in the cookie
- `updateData` will be called from `commitSession` when a session ID already exists in the cookie
- `deleteData` is called from `destroySession`

The following example shows how you could do this using a generic database client:

```ts
import { createSessionStorage } from "react-router";

function createDatabaseSessionStorage({
  cookie,
  host,
  port,
}) {
  // Configure your database client...
  const db = createDatabaseClient(host, port);

  return createSessionStorage({
    cookie,
    async createData(data, expires) {
      // `expires` is a Date after which the data should be considered
      // invalid. You could use it to invalidate the data somehow or
      // automatically purge this record from your database.
      const id = await db.insert(data);
      return id;
    },
    async readData(id) {
      return (await db.select(id)) || null;
    },
    async updateData(id, data, expires) {
      await db.update(id, data);
    },
    async deleteData(id) {
      await db.delete(id);
    },
  });
}
```

And then you can use it like this:

```ts
const { getSession, commitSession, destroySession } =
  createDatabaseSessionStorage({
    host: "localhost",
    port: 1234,
    cookie: {
      name: "__session",
      sameSite: "lax",
    },
  });
```

The `expires` argument to `createData` and `updateData` is the same `Date` at which the cookie itself expires and is no longer valid. You can use this information to automatically purge the session record from your database to save on space, or to ensure that you do not otherwise return any data for old, expired cookies.

### Additional session utils

There are also several other session utilities available if you need them:

- [`isSession`][is-session]
- [`createMemorySessionStorage`][create-memory-session-storage]
- [`createSession`][create-session] (custom storage)
- [`createFileSessionStorage`][create-file-session-storage] (node)
- [`createWorkersKVSessionStorage`][create-workers-kv-session-storage] (Cloudflare Workers)
- [`createArcTableSessionStorage`][create-arc-table-session-storage] (architect, Amazon DynamoDB)

## Cookies

A [cookie][cookie] is a small piece of information that your server sends someone in a HTTP response that their browser will send back on subsequent requests. This technique is a fundamental building block of many interactive websites that adds state so you can build authentication (see [sessions][sessions]), shopping carts, user preferences, and many other features that require remembering who is "logged in".

React Router's [`Cookie` interface][cookie-api] provides a logical, reusable container for cookie metadata.

### Using cookies

While you may create these cookies manually, it is more common to use a [session storage][sessions].

In React Router, you will typically work with cookies in your `loader` and/or `action` functions, since those are the places where you need to read and write data.

Let's say you have a banner on your e-commerce site that prompts users to check out the items you currently have on sale. The banner spans the top of your homepage, and includes a button on the side that allows the user to dismiss the banner so they don't see it for at least another week.

First, create a cookie:

```ts filename=app/cookies.server.ts
import { createCookie } from "react-router";

export const userPrefs = createCookie("user-prefs", {
  maxAge: 604_800, // one week
});
```

Then, you can `import` the cookie and use it in your `loader` and/or `action`. The `loader` in this case just checks the value of the user preference so you can use it in your component for deciding whether to render the banner. When the button is clicked, the `<form>` calls the `action` on the server and reloads the page without the banner.

### User preferences example

```tsx filename=app/routes/home.tsx lines=[4,9-11,18-20,29]
import { Link, Form, redirect } from "react-router";
import type { Route } from "./+types/home";

import { userPrefs } from "../cookies.server";

export async function loader({
  request,
}: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const cookieHeader = request.headers.get("Cookie");
  const cookie =
    (await userPrefs.parse(cookieHeader)) || {};
  return { showBanner: cookie.showBanner };
}

export async function action({
  request,
}: Route.ActionArgs) {
  const cookieHeader = request.headers.get("Cookie");
  const cookie =
    (await userPrefs.parse(cookieHeader)) || {};
  const bodyParams = await request.formData();

  if (bodyParams.get("bannerVisibility") === "hidden") {
    cookie.showBanner = false;
  }

  return redirect("/", {
    headers: {
      "Set-Cookie": await userPrefs.serialize(cookie),
    },
  });
}

export default function Home({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      {loaderData.showBanner ? (
        <div>
          <Link to="/sale">Don't miss our sale!</Link>
          <Form method="post">
            <input
              type="hidden"
              name="bannerVisibility"
              value="hidden"
            />
            <button type="submit">Hide</button>
          </Form>
        </div>
      ) : null}
      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Cookie attributes

Cookies have [several attributes][cookie-attrs] that control when they expire, how they are accessed, and where they are sent. Any of these attributes may be specified either in `createCookie(name, options)`, or during `serialize()` when the `Set-Cookie` header is generated.

```ts
const cookie = createCookie("user-prefs", {
  // These are defaults for this cookie.
  path: "/",
  sameSite: "lax",
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: true,
  expires: new Date(Date.now() + 60_000),
  maxAge: 60,
});

// You can either use the defaults:
cookie.serialize(userPrefs);

// Or override individual ones as needed:
cookie.serialize(userPrefs, { sameSite: "strict" });
```

Please read [more info about these attributes][cookie-attrs] to get a better understanding of what they do.

### Signing cookies

It is possible to sign a cookie to automatically verify its contents when it is received. Since it's relatively easy to spoof HTTP headers, this is a good idea for any information that you do not want someone to be able to fake, like authentication information (see [sessions][sessions]).

To sign a cookie, provide one or more `secrets` when you first create the cookie:

```ts
const cookie = createCookie("user-prefs", {
  secrets: ["s3cret1"],
});
```

Cookies that have one or more `secrets` will be stored and verified in a way that ensures the cookie's integrity.

Secrets may be rotated by adding new secrets to the front of the `secrets` array. Cookies that have been signed with old secrets will still be decoded successfully in `cookie.parse()`, and the newest secret (the first one in the array) will always be used to sign outgoing cookies created in `cookie.serialize()`.

```ts filename=app/cookies.server.ts
export const cookie = createCookie("user-prefs", {
  secrets: ["n3wsecr3t", "olds3cret"],
});
```

```tsx filename=app/routes/my-route.tsx
import { data } from "react-router";
import { cookie } from "../cookies.server";
import type { Route } from "./+types/my-route";

export async function loader({
  request,
}: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const oldCookie = request.headers.get("Cookie");
  // oldCookie may have been signed with "olds3cret", but still parses ok
  const value = await cookie.parse(oldCookie);

  return data("...", {
    headers: {
      // Set-Cookie is signed with "n3wsecr3t"
      "Set-Cookie": await cookie.serialize(value),
    },
  });
}
```

### Additional cookie utils

There are also several other cookie utilities available if you need them:

- [`isCookie`][is-cookie]
- [`createCookie`][create-cookie]

title: Progressive Enhancement
---

# Progressive Enhancement

> Progressive enhancement is a strategy in web design that puts emphasis on web content first, allowing everyone to access the basic content and functionality of a web page, whilst users with additional browser features or faster Internet access receive the enhanced version instead.

<cite>- [Wikipedia][wikipedia]</cite>

When using React Router with Server-Side Rendering (the default in framework mode), you can automatically leverage the benefits of progressive enhancement.

## Why Progressive Enhancement Matters

Coined in 2003 by Steven Champeon & Nick Finck, the phrase emerged during a time of varied CSS and JavaScript support across different browsers, with many users actually browsing the web with JavaScript disabled.

Today, we are fortunate to develop for a much more consistent web and where the majority of users have JavaScript enabled.

However, we still believe in the core principles of progressive enhancement in React Router. It leads to fast and resilient apps with simple development workflows.

**Performance**: While it's easy to think that only 5% of your users have slow connections, the reality is that 100% of your users have slow connections 5% of the time.

**Resilience**: Everybody has JavaScript disabled until it's loaded.

**Simplicity**: Building your apps in a progressively enhanced way with React Router is actually simpler than building a traditional SPA.

## Performance

Server rendering allows your app to do more things in parallel than a typical [Single Page App (SPA)][spa], making the initial loading experience and subsequent navigations faster.

Typical SPAs send a blank document and only start doing work when JavaScript has loaded:

```
HTML        |---|
JavaScript      |---------|
Data                      |---------------|
                            page rendered 👆
```

A React Router app can start doing work the moment the request hits the server and stream the response so that the browser can start downloading JavaScript, other assets, and data in parallel:

```
               👇 first byte
HTML        |---|-----------|
JavaScript      |---------|
Data        |---------------|
              page rendered 👆
```

## Resilience and Accessibility

While your users probably don't browse the web with JavaScript disabled, everybody uses the websites without JavaScript before it finishes loading. React Router embraces progressive enhancement by building on top of HTML, allowing you to build your app in a way that works without JavaScript, and then layer on JavaScript to enhance the experience.

The simplest case is a `<Link to="/account">`. These render an `<a href="/account">` tag that works without JavaScript. When JavaScript loads, React Router will intercept clicks and handle the navigation with client side routing. This gives you more control over the UX instead of just spinning favicons in the browser tab--but it works either way.

Now consider a simple add to cart button:

```tsx
export function AddToCart({ id }) {
  return (
    <Form method="post" action="/add-to-cart">
      <input type="hidden" name="id" value={id} />
      <button type="submit">Add To Cart</button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

Whether JavaScript has loaded or not doesn't matter, this button will add the product to the cart.

When JavaScript loads, React Router will intercept the form submission and handle it client side. This allows you to add your own pending UI, or other client side behavior.

## Simplicity

When you start to rely on basic features of the web like HTML and URLs, you will find that you reach for client side state and state management much less.

Consider the button from before, with no fundamental change to the code, we can pepper in some client side behavior:

```tsx lines=[1,4,7,10-12,14]
import { useFetcher } from "react-router";

export function AddToCart({ id }) {
  const fetcher = useFetcher();

  return (
    <fetcher.Form method="post" action="/add-to-cart">
      <input name="id" value={id} />
      <button type="submit">
        {fetcher.state === "submitting"
          ? "Adding..."
          : "Add To Cart"}
      </button>
    </fetcher.Form>
  );
}
```

This feature continues to work the very same as it did before when JavaScript is loading, but once JavaScript loads:

- `useFetcher` no longer causes a navigation like `<Form>` does, so the user can stay on the same page and keep shopping
- The app code determines the pending UI instead of spinning favicons in the browser

It's not about building it two different ways–once for JavaScript and once without–it's about building it in iterations. Start with the simplest version of the feature and ship it; then iterate to an enhanced user experience.

Not only will the user get a progressively enhanced experience, but the app developer gets to "progressively enhance" the UI without changing the fundamental design of the feature.

Another example where progressive enhancement leads to simplicity is with the URL. When you start with a URL, you don't need to worry about client side state management. You can just use the URL as the source of truth for the UI.

```tsx
export function SearchBox() {
  return (
    <Form method="get" action="/search">
      <input type="search" name="query" />
      <SearchIcon />
    </Form>
  );
}
```

This component doesn't need any state management. It just renders a form that submits to `/search`. When JavaScript loads, React Router will intercept the form submission and handle it client side. Here's the next iteration:

```tsx lines=[1,4-6,11]
import { useNavigation } from "react-router";

export function SearchBox() {
  const navigation = useNavigation();
  const isSearching =
    navigation.location.pathname === "/search";

  return (
    <Form method="get" action="/search">
      <input type="search" name="query" />
      {isSearching ? <Spinner /> : <SearchIcon />}
    </Form>
  );
}
```

No fundamental change in architecture, simply a progressive enhancement for both the user and the code.

title: Hydration
hidden: true
---

There are a few nuances worth noting around the behavior of `HydrateFallback`:

- It is only relevant on initial document request and hydration, and will not be rendered on any subsequent client-side navigations
- It is only relevant when you are also setting [`clientLoader.hydrate=true`][hydrate-true] on a given route
- It is also relevant if you do have a `clientLoader` without a server `loader`, as this implies `clientLoader.hydrate=true` since there is otherwise no loader data at all to return from `useLoaderData`
  - Even if you do not specify a `HydrateFallback` in this case, React Router will not render your route component and will bubble up to any ancestor `HydrateFallback` component
  - This is to ensure that `useLoaderData` remains "happy-path"
  - Without a server `loader`, `useLoaderData` would return `undefined` in any rendered route components
- You cannot render an `<Outlet/>` in a `HydrateFallback` because children routes can't be guaranteed to operate correctly since their ancestor loader data may not yet be available if they are running `clientLoader` functions on hydration (i.e., use cases such as `useRouteLoaderData()` or `useMatches()`)

title: Automatic Code Splitting

# Automatic Code Splitting

When using React Router's framework features, your application is automatically code split to improve the performance of initial load times when users visit your application.

## Code Splitting by Route

Consider this simple route config:

```tsx filename=app/routes.ts
import {
  type RouteConfig,
  route,
} from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
  route("/contact", "./contact.tsx"),
  route("/about", "./about.tsx"),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

Instead of bundling all routes into a single giant build, the modules referenced (`contact.tsx` and `about.tsx`) become entry points to the bundler.

Because these entry points are coupled to URL segments, React Router knows just from a URL which bundles are needed in the browser, and more importantly, which are not.

If the user visits `"/about"` then the bundles for `about.tsx` will be loaded but not `contact.tsx`. This ensures drastically reduces the JavaScript footprint for initial page loads and speeds up your application.

## Removal of Server Code

Any server-only [Route Module APIs][route-module] will be removed from the bundles. Consider this route module:

```tsx
export async function loader() {
  return { message: "hello" };
}

export async function action() {
  console.log(Date.now());
  return { ok: true };
}

export async function headers() {
  return { "Cache-Control": "max-age=300" };
}

export default function Component({ loaderData }) {
  return <div>{loaderData.message}</div>;
}
```

After building for the browser, only the `Component` will still be in the bundle, so you can use server-only code in the other module exports.

title: Race Conditions
---

# Race Conditions

While impossible to eliminate every possible race condition in your application, React Router automatically handles the most common race conditions found in web user interfaces.

## Browser Behavior

React Router's handling of network concurrency is heavily inspired by the behavior of web browsers when processing documents.

Consider clicking a link to a new document, and then clicking a different link before the new page has finished loading. The browser will:

1. cancel the first request
2. immediately process the new navigation

The same behavior applies to form submissions. When a pending form submission is interrupted by a new one, the first is canceled and the new submission is immediately processed.

## React Router Behavior

Like the browser, interrupted navigations with links and form submissions will cancel in flight data requests and immediately process the new event.

Fetchers are a bit more nuanced since they are not singleton events like navigation. Fetchers can't interrupt other fetcher instances, but they can interrupt themselves and the behavior is the same as everything else: cancel the interrupted request and immediately process the new one.

Fetchers do, however, interact with each other when it comes to revalidation. After a fetcher's action request returns to the browser, a revalidation for all page data is sent. This means multiple revalidation requests can be in-flight at the same time. React Router will commit all "fresh" revalidation responses and cancel any stale requests. A stale request is any request that started _earlier_ than one that has returned.

This management of the network prevents the most common UI bugs caused by network race conditions.

Since networks are unpredictable, and your server still processes these cancelled requests, your backend may still experience race conditions and have potential data integrity issues. These risks are the same risks as using default browser behavior with plain HTML `<forms>`, which we consider to be low, and outside the scope of React Router.

## Practical Benefits

Consider building a type-ahead combobox. As the user types, you send a request to the server. As they type each new character you send a new request. It's important to not show the user results for a value that's not in the text field anymore.

When using a fetcher, this is automatically managed for you. Consider this pseudo-code:

```tsx
// route("/city-search", "./search-cities.ts")
export async function loader({ request }) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);
  return searchCities(searchParams.get("q"));
}
```

```tsx
export function CitySearchCombobox() {
  const fetcher = useFetcher();

  return (
    <fetcher.Form action="/city-search">
      <Combobox aria-label="Cities">
        <ComboboxInput
          name="q"
          onChange={(event) =>
            // submit the form onChange to get the list of cities
            fetcher.submit(event.target.form)
          }
        />

        {fetcher.data ? (
          <ComboboxPopover className="shadow-popup">
            {fetcher.data.length > 0 ? (
              <ComboboxList>
                {fetcher.data.map((city) => (
                  <ComboboxOption
                    key={city.id}
                    value={city.name}
                  />
                ))}
              </ComboboxList>
            ) : (
              <span>No results found</span>
            )}
          </ComboboxPopover>
        ) : null}
      </Combobox>
    </fetcher.Form>
  );
}
```

Calls to `fetcher.submit` will cancel pending requests on that fetcher automatically. This ensures you never show the user results for a request for a different input value.

# State Management

State management in React typically involves maintaining a synchronized cache of server data on the client side. However, when using React Router as your framework, most of the traditional caching solutions become redundant because of how it inherently handles data synchronization.

## Understanding State Management in React

In a typical React context, when we refer to "state management", we're primarily discussing how we synchronize server state with the client. A more apt term could be "cache management" because the server is the source of truth and the client state is mostly functioning as a cache.

Popular caching solutions in React include:

- **Redux:** A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- **React Query:** Hooks for fetching, caching, and updating asynchronous data in React.
- **Apollo:** A comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that integrates with GraphQL.

In certain scenarios, using these libraries may be warranted. However, with React Router's unique server-focused approach, their utility becomes less prevalent. In fact, most React Router applications forgo them entirely.

## How React Router Simplifies State

React Router seamlessly bridges the gap between the backend and frontend via mechanisms like loaders, actions, and forms with automatic synchronization through revalidation. This offers developers the ability to directly use server state within components without managing a cache, the network communication, or data revalidation, making most client-side caching redundant.

Here's why using typical React state patterns might be an anti-pattern in React Router:

1. **Network-related State:** If your React state is managing anything related to the network—such as data from loaders, pending form submissions, or navigational states—it's likely that you're managing state that React Router already manages:

   - **[`useNavigation`][use_navigation]**: This hook gives you access to `navigation.state`, `navigation.formData`, `navigation.location`, etc.
   - **[`useFetcher`][use_fetcher]**: This facilitates interaction with `fetcher.state`, `fetcher.formData`, `fetcher.data` etc.
   - **[`loaderData`][loader_data]**: Access the data for a route.
   - **[`actionData`][action_data]**: Access the data from the latest action.

2. **Storing Data in React Router:** A lot of data that developers might be tempted to store in React state has a more natural home in React Router, such as:

   - **URL Search Params:** Parameters within the URL that hold state.
   - **[Cookies][cookies]:** Small pieces of data stored on the user's device.
   - **[Server Sessions][sessions]:** Server-managed user sessions.
   - **Server Caches:** Cached data on the server side for quicker retrieval.

3. **Performance Considerations:** At times, client state is leveraged to avoid redundant data fetching. With React Router, you can use the [`Cache-Control`][cache_control_header] headers within `loader`s, allowing you to tap into the browser's native cache. However, this approach has its limitations and should be used judiciously. It's usually more beneficial to optimize backend queries or implement a server cache. This is because such changes benefit all users and do away with the need for individual browser caches.

As a developer transitioning to React Router, it's essential to recognize and embrace its inherent efficiencies rather than applying traditional React patterns. React Router offers a streamlined solution to state management leading to less code, fresh data, and no state synchronization bugs.

## Examples

### Network Related State

For examples on using React Router's internal state to manage network related state, refer to [Pending UI][pending_ui].

### URL Search Params

Consider a UI that lets the user customize between list view or detail view. Your instinct might be to reach for React state:

```tsx bad lines=[2,6,9]
export function List() {
  const [view, setView] = useState("list");
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => setView("list")}>
          View as List
        </button>
        <button onClick={() => setView("details")}>
          View with Details
        </button>
      </div>
      {view === "list" ? <ListView /> : <DetailView />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now consider you want the URL to update when the user changes the view. Note the state synchronization:

```tsx bad lines=[7,16,24]
import { useNavigate, useSearchParams } from "react-router";

export function List() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const [searchParams] = useSearchParams();
  const [view, setView] = useState(
    searchParams.get("view") || "list"
  );

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <button
          onClick={() => {
            setView("list");
            navigate(`?view=list`);
          }}
        >
          View as List
        </button>
        <button
          onClick={() => {
            setView("details");
            navigate(`?view=details`);
          }}
        >
          View with Details
        </button>
      </div>
      {view === "list" ? <ListView /> : <DetailView />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Instead of synchronizing state, you can simply read and set the state in the URL directly with boring old HTML forms:

```tsx good lines=[5,9-16]
import { Form, useSearchParams } from "react-router";

export function List() {
  const [searchParams] = useSearchParams();
  const view = searchParams.get("view") || "list";

  return (
    <div>
      <Form>
        <button name="view" value="list">
          View as List
        </button>
        <button name="view" value="details">
          View with Details
        </button>
      </Form>
      {view === "list" ? <ListView /> : <DetailView />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Persistent UI State

Consider a UI that toggles a sidebar's visibility. We have three ways to handle the state:

1. React state
2. Browser local storage
3. Cookies

In this discussion, we'll break down the trade-offs associated with each method.

#### React State

React state provides a simple solution for temporary state storage.

**Pros**:

- **Simple**: Easy to implement and understand.
- **Encapsulated**: State is scoped to the component.

**Cons**:

- **Transient**: Doesn't survive page refreshes, returning to the page later, or unmounting and remounting the component.

**Implementation**:

```tsx
function Sidebar() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen((open) => !open)}>
        {isOpen ? "Close" : "Open"}
      </button>
      <aside hidden={!isOpen}>
        <Outlet />
      </aside>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Local Storage

To persist state beyond the component lifecycle, browser local storage is a step-up. See our doc on [Client Data][client_data] for more advanced examples.

**Pros**:

- **Persistent**: Maintains state across page refreshes and component mounts/unmounts.
- **Encapsulated**: State is scoped to the component.

**Cons**:

- **Requires Synchronization**: React components must sync up with local storage to initialize and save the current state.
- **Server Rendering Limitation**: The [`window`][window_global] and [`localStorage`][local_storage_global] objects are not accessible during server-side rendering, so state must be initialized in the browser with an effect.
- **UI Flickering**: On initial page loads, the state in local storage may not match what was rendered by the server and the UI will flicker when JavaScript loads.

**Implementation**:

```tsx
function Sidebar() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

  // synchronize initially
  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    const isOpen = window.localStorage.getItem("sidebar");
    setIsOpen(isOpen);
  }, []);

  // synchronize on change
  useEffect(() => {
    window.localStorage.setItem("sidebar", isOpen);
  }, [isOpen]);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen((open) => !open)}>
        {isOpen ? "Close" : "Open"}
      </button>
      <aside hidden={!isOpen}>
        <Outlet />
      </aside>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this approach, state must be initialized within an effect. This is crucial to avoid complications during server-side rendering. Directly initializing the React state from `localStorage` will cause errors since `window.localStorage` is unavailable during server rendering.

```tsx bad lines=[4]
function Sidebar() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(
    // error: window is not defined
    window.localStorage.getItem("sidebar")
  );

  // ...
}
```

By initializing the state within an effect, there's potential for a mismatch between the server-rendered state and the state stored in local storage. This discrepancy will lead to brief UI flickering shortly after the page renders and should be avoided.

#### Cookies

Cookies offer a comprehensive solution for this use case. However, this method introduces added preliminary setup before making the state accessible within the component.

**Pros**:

- **Server Rendering**: State is available on the server for rendering and even for server actions.
- **Single Source of Truth**: Eliminates state synchronization hassles.
- **Persistence**: Maintains state across page loads and component mounts/unmounts. State can even persist across devices if you switch to a database-backed session.
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Functions even before JavaScript loads.

**Cons**:

- **Boilerplate**: Requires more code because of the network.
- **Exposed**: The state is not encapsulated to a single component, other parts of the app must be aware of the cookie.

**Implementation**:

First we'll need to create a cookie object:

```tsx
import { createCookie } from "react-router";
export const prefs = createCookie("prefs");
```

Next we set up the server action and loader to read and write the cookie:

```tsx filename=app/routes/sidebar.tsx
import { data, Outlet } from "react-router";
import type { Route } from "./+types/sidebar";

import { prefs } from "./prefs-cookie";

// read the state from the cookie
export async function loader({
  request,
}: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const cookieHeader = request.headers.get("Cookie");
  const cookie = (await prefs.parse(cookieHeader)) || {};
  return data({ sidebarIsOpen: cookie.sidebarIsOpen });
}

// write the state to the cookie
export async function action({
  request,
}: Route.ActionArgs) {
  const cookieHeader = request.headers.get("Cookie");
  const cookie = (await prefs.parse(cookieHeader)) || {};
  const formData = await request.formData();

  const isOpen = formData.get("sidebar") === "open";
  cookie.sidebarIsOpen = isOpen;

  return data(isOpen, {
    headers: {
      "Set-Cookie": await prefs.serialize(cookie),
    },
  });
}
```

After the server code is set up, we can use the cookie state in our UI:

```tsx
function Sidebar({ loaderData }: Route.ComponentProps) {
  const fetcher = useFetcher();
  let { sidebarIsOpen } = loaderData;

  // use optimistic UI to immediately change the UI state
  if (fetcher.formData?.has("sidebar")) {
    sidebarIsOpen =
      fetcher.formData.get("sidebar") === "open";
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <fetcher.Form method="post">
        <button
          name="sidebar"
          value={sidebarIsOpen ? "closed" : "open"}
        >
          {sidebarIsOpen ? "Close" : "Open"}
        </button>
      </fetcher.Form>
      <aside hidden={!sidebarIsOpen}>
        <Outlet />
      </aside>
    </div>
  );
}
```

While this is certainly more code that touches more of the application to account for the network requests and responses, the UX is greatly improved. Additionally, state comes from a single source of truth without any state synchronization required.

In summary, each of the discussed methods offers a unique set of benefits and challenges:

- **React state**: Offers simple but transient state management.
- **Local Storage**: Provides persistence but with synchronization requirements and UI flickering.
- **Cookies**: Delivers robust, persistent state management at the cost of added boilerplate.

None of these are wrong, but if you want to persist the state across visits, cookies offer the best user experience.

### Form Validation and Action Data

Client-side validation can augment the user experience, but similar enhancements can be achieved by leaning more towards server-side processing and letting it handle the complexities.

The following example illustrates the inherent complexities of managing network state, coordinating state from the server, and implementing validation redundantly on both the client and server sides. It's just for illustration, so forgive any obvious bugs or problems you find.

```tsx bad lines=[2,11,27,38,63]
export function Signup() {
  // A multitude of React State declarations
  const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);

  const [userName, setUserName] = useState("");
  const [userNameError, setUserNameError] = useState(null);

  const [password, setPassword] = useState(null);
  const [passwordError, setPasswordError] = useState("");

  // Replicating server-side logic in the client
  function validateForm() {
    setUserNameError(null);
    setPasswordError(null);
    const errors = validateSignupForm(userName, password);
    if (errors) {
      if (errors.userName) {
        setUserNameError(errors.userName);
      }
      if (errors.password) {
        setPasswordError(errors.password);
      }
    }
    return Boolean(errors);
  }

  // Manual network interaction handling
  async function handleSubmit() {
    if (validateForm()) {
      setSubmitting(true);
      const res = await postJSON("/api/signup", {
        userName,
        password,
      });
      const json = await res.json();
      setIsSubmitting(false);

      // Server state synchronization to the client
      if (json.errors) {
        if (json.errors.userName) {
          setUserNameError(json.errors.userName);
        }
        if (json.errors.password) {
          setPasswordError(json.errors.password);
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return (
    <form
      onSubmit={(event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        handleSubmit();
      }}
    >
      <p>
        <input
          type="text"
          name="username"
          value={userName}
          onChange={() => {
            // Synchronizing form state for the fetch
            setUserName(event.target.value);
          }}
        />
        {userNameError ? <i>{userNameError}</i> : null}
      </p>

      <p>
        <input
          type="password"
          name="password"
          onChange={(event) => {
            // Synchronizing form state for the fetch
            setPassword(event.target.value);
          }}
        />
        {passwordError ? <i>{passwordError}</i> : null}
      </p>

      <button disabled={isSubmitting} type="submit">
        Sign Up
      </button>

      {isSubmitting ? <BusyIndicator /> : null}
    </form>
  );
}
```

The backend endpoint, `/api/signup`, also performs validation and sends error feedback. Note that some essential validation, like detecting duplicate usernames, can only be done server-side using information the client doesn't have access to.

```tsx bad
export async function signupHandler(request: Request) {
  const errors = await validateSignupRequest(request);
  if (errors) {
    return { ok: false, errors: errors };
  }
  await signupUser(request);
  return { ok: true, errors: null };
}
```

Now, let's contrast this with a React Router-based implementation. The action remains consistent, but the component is vastly simplified due to the direct utilization of server state via `actionData`, and leveraging the network state that React Router inherently manages.

```tsx filename=app/routes/signup.tsx good lines=[20-22]
import { useNavigation } from "react-router";
import type { Route } from "./+types/signup";

export async function action({
  request,
}: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const errors = await validateSignupRequest(request);
  if (errors) {
    return { ok: false, errors: errors };
  }
  await signupUser(request);
  return { ok: true, errors: null };
}

export function Signup({
  actionData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  const navigation = useNavigation();

  const userNameError = actionData?.errors?.userName;
  const passwordError = actionData?.errors?.password;
  const isSubmitting = navigation.formAction === "/signup";

  return (
    <Form method="post">
      <p>
        <input type="text" name="username" />
        {userNameError ? <i>{userNameError}</i> : null}
      </p>

      <p>
        <input type="password" name="password" />
        {passwordError ? <i>{passwordError}</i> : null}
      </p>

      <button disabled={isSubmitting} type="submit">
        Sign Up
      </button>

      {isSubmitting ? <BusyIndicator /> : null}
    </Form>
  );
}
```

The extensive state management from our previous example is distilled into just three code lines. We eliminate the necessity for React state, change event listeners, submit handlers, and state management libraries for such network interactions.

Direct access to the server state is made possible through `actionData`, and network state through `useNavigation` (or `useFetcher`).

As bonus party trick, the form is functional even before JavaScript loads (see [Progressive Enhancement][progressive_enhancement]). Instead of React Router managing the network operations, the default browser behaviors step in.

If you ever find yourself entangled in managing and synchronizing state for network operations, React Router likely offers a more elegant solution.

title: Special Files
---

# Special Files

There are a few special files that React Router looks for in your project. Not all of these files are required

## react-router.config.ts

**This file is optional**

The config file is used to configure certain aspects of your app, such as whether you are using server-side rendering, where certain directories are located, and more.

```tsx filename=react-router.config.ts
import type { Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";

export default {
  // Config options...
} satisfies Config;
```

See the details on [react-router config API][react-router-config] for more information.

## root.tsx

**This file is required**

The "root" route (`app/root.tsx`) is the only _required_ route in your React Router application because it is the parent to all routes in your `routes/` directory and is in charge of rendering the root `<html>` document.

Because the root route manages your document, it is the proper place to render a handful of "document-level" components React Router provides. These components are to be used once inside your root route and they include everything React Router figured out or built in order for your page to render properly.

```tsx filename=app/root.tsx
import type { LinksFunction } from "react-router";
import {
  Links,
  Meta,
  Outlet,
  Scripts,
  ScrollRestoration,
} from "react-router";

import "./global-styles.css";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charSet="utf-8" />
        <meta
          name="viewport"
          content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"
        />

        {/* All `meta` exports on all routes will render here */}
        <Meta />

        {/* All `link` exports on all routes will render here */}
        <Links />
      </head>
      <body>
        {/* Child routes render here */}
        <Outlet />

        {/* Manages scroll position for client-side transitions */}
        {/* If you use a nonce-based content security policy for scripts, you must provide the `nonce` prop. Otherwise, omit the nonce prop as shown here. */}
        <ScrollRestoration />

        {/* Script tags go here */}
        {/* If you use a nonce-based content security policy for scripts, you must provide the `nonce` prop. Otherwise, omit the nonce prop as shown here. */}
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Layout export

The root route supports all [route module exports][route-module].

The root route also supports an additional optional `Layout` export. The `Layout` component serves 2 purposes:

1. Avoid duplicating your document's "app shell" across your root component, `HydrateFallback`, and `ErrorBoundary`
2. Prevent React from re-mounting your app shell elements when switching between the root component/`HydrateFallback`/`ErrorBoundary` which can cause a FOUC if React removes and re-adds `<link rel="stylesheet">` tags from your `<Links>` component.

```tsx filename=app/root.tsx lines=[10-31]
export function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charSet="utf-8" />
        <meta
          name="viewport"
          content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"
        />
        <Meta />
        <Links />
      </head>
      <body>
        {/* children will be the root Component, ErrorBoundary, or HydrateFallback */}
        {children}
        <Scripts />
        <ScrollRestoration />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return <Outlet />;
}

export function ErrorBoundary() {}
```

**A note on `useLoaderData`in the `Layout` Component**

`useLoaderData` is not permitted to be used in `ErrorBoundary` components because it is intended for the happy-path route rendering, and its typings have a built-in assumption that the `loader` ran successfully and returned something. That assumption doesn't hold in an `ErrorBoundary` because it could have been the `loader` that threw and triggered the boundary! In order to access loader data in `ErrorBoundary`'s, you can use `useRouteLoaderData` which accounts for the loader data potentially being `undefined`.

Because your `Layout` component is used in both success and error flows, this same restriction holds. If you need to fork logic in your `Layout` depending on if it was a successful request or not, you can use `useRouteLoaderData("root")` and `useRouteError()`.

<docs-warn>Because your `<Layout>` component is used for rendering the `ErrorBoundary`, you should be _very defensive_ to ensure that you can render your `ErrorBoundary` without encountering any render errors. If your `Layout` throws another error trying to render the boundary, then it can't be used and your UI will fall back to the very minimal built-in default `ErrorBoundary`.</docs-warn>

```tsx filename=app/root.tsx lines=[6-7,19-29,32-34]
export function Layout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  const data = useRouteLoaderData("root");
  const error = useRouteError();

  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charSet="utf-8" />
        <meta
          name="viewport"
          content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"
        />
        <Meta />

                  data?.themeVar || defaultThemeVar
                }
              }
            `,
          }}
        />
      </head>
      <body>
        {data ? (
          <Analytics token={data.analyticsToken} />
        ) : null}
        {children}
        <ScrollRestoration />
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## routes.ts

**This file is required**

The `routes.ts` file is used to configure which url patterns are matched to which route modules.

```tsx filename=app/routes.ts
import {
  type RouteConfig,
  route,
} from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
  route("some/path", "./some/file.tsx"),
  // pattern ^           ^ module file
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

See the [routing guide][routing] for more information.

## entry.client.tsx

**This file is optional**

By default, React Router will handle hydrating your app on the client for you. You can reveal the default entry client file with the following:

```shellscript nonumber
react-router reveal
```

This file is the entry point for the browser and is responsible for hydrating the markup generated by the server in your [server entry module][server-entry], however you can also initialize any other client-side code here.

```tsx filename=app/entry.client.tsx
import { startTransition, StrictMode } from "react";
import { hydrateRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { HydratedRouter } from "react-router/dom";

startTransition(() => {
  hydrateRoot(
    document,
    <StrictMode>
      <HydratedRouter />
    </StrictMode>
  );
});
```

This is the first piece of code that runs in the browser. You can initialize client side libraries, add client only providers, etc.

## entry.server.tsx

**This file is optional**

By default, React Router will handle generating the HTTP Response for you. You can reveal the default entry server file with the following:

```shellscript nonumber
react-router reveal
```

The `default` export of this module is a function that lets you create the response, including HTTP status, headers, and HTML, giving you full control over the way the markup is generated and sent to the client.

This module should render the markup for the current page using a `<ServerRouter>` element with the `context` and `url` for the current request. This markup will (optionally) be re-hydrated once JavaScript loads in the browser using the [client entry module][client-entry].

### `streamTimeout`

If you are [streaming] responses, you can export an optional `streamTimeout` value (in milliseconds) that will control the amount of time the server will wait for streamed promises to settle before rejecting outstanding promises them and closing the stream.

It's recommended to decouple this value from the timeout in which you abort the React renderer. You should always set the React rendering timeout to a higher value so it has time to stream down the underlying rejections from your `streamTimeout`.

```tsx lines=[1-2,13-15]
// Reject all pending promises from handler functions after 10 seconds
export const streamTimeout = 10000;

export default function handleRequest(...) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // ...

    const { pipe, abort } = renderToPipeableStream(
      <ServerRouter context={routerContext} url={request.url} />,
      { /* ... */ }
    );

    // Abort the streaming render pass after 11 seconds to allow the rejected
    // boundaries to be flushed
    setTimeout(abort, streamTimeout + 1000);
  });
}
```

### `handleDataRequest`

You can export an optional `handleDataRequest` function that will allow you to modify the response of a data request. These are the requests that do not render HTML, but rather return the loader and action data to the browser once client-side hydration has occurred.

```tsx
export function handleDataRequest(
  response: Response,
  {
    request,
    params,
    context,
  }: LoaderFunctionArgs | ActionFunctionArgs
) {
  response.headers.set("X-Custom-Header", "value");
  return response;
}
```

### `handleError`

By default, React Router will log encountered server-side errors to the console. If you'd like more control over the logging, or would like to also report these errors to an external service, then you can export an optional `handleError` function which will give you control (and will disable the built-in error logging).

```tsx
export function handleError(
  error: unknown,
  {
    request,
    params,
    context,
  }: LoaderFunctionArgs | ActionFunctionArgs
) {
  if (!request.signal.aborted) {
    sendErrorToErrorReportingService(error);
    console.error(formatErrorForJsonLogging(error));
  }
}
```

_Note that you generally want to avoid logging when the request was aborted, since React Router's cancellation and race-condition handling can cause a lot of requests to be aborted._

### Streaming Rendering Errors

When you are streaming your HTML responses via [`renderToPipeableStream`][rendertopipeablestream] or [`renderToReadableStream`][rendertoreadablestream], your own `handleError` implementation will only handle errors encountered during the initial shell render. If you encounter a rendering error during subsequent streamed rendering you will need to handle these errors manually since the React Router server has already sent the Response by that point.

For `renderToPipeableStream`, you can handle these errors in the `onError` callback function. You will need to toggle a boolean in `onShellReady` so you know if the error was a shell rendering error (and can be ignored) or an async

For an example, please refer to the default [`entry.server.tsx`][node-streaming-entry-server] for Node.

**Thrown Responses**

Note that this does not handle thrown `Response` instances from your `loader`/`action` functions. The intention of this handler is to find bugs in your code which result in unexpected thrown errors. If you are detecting a scenario and throwing a 401/404/etc. `Response` in your `loader`/`action` then it's an expected flow that is handled by your code. If you also wish to log, or send those to an external service, that should be done at the time you throw the response.

## `.server` modules

While not strictly necessary, `.server` modules are a good way to explicitly mark entire modules as server-only.
The build will fail if any code in a `.server` file or `.server` directory accidentally ends up in the client module graph.

```txt
app
├── .server 👈 marks all files in this directory as server-only
│   ├── auth.ts
│   └── db.ts
├── cms.server.ts 👈 marks this file as server-only
├── root.tsx
└── routes.ts
```

`.server` modules must be within your app directory.

Refer to the Route Module section in the sidebar for more information.

## `.client` modules

While uncommon, you may have a file or dependency that uses module side effects in the browser. You can use `*.client.ts` on file names or nest files within `.client` directories to force them out of server bundles.

```ts filename=feature-check.client.ts
// this would break the server
export const supportsVibrationAPI =
  "vibrate" in window.navigator;
```

Note that values exported from this module will all be `undefined` on the server, so the only places to use them are in [`useEffect`][use_effect] and user events like click handlers.

```ts
import { supportsVibrationAPI } from "./feature-check.client.ts";

console.log(supportsVibrationAPI);
// server: undefined
// client: true | false
```

title: Hot Module Replacement
---

# Hot Module Replacement

Hot Module Replacement is a technique for updating modules in your app without needing to reload the page.
It's a great developer experience, and React Router supports it when using Vite.

HMR does its best to preserve browser state across updates.
For example, let's say you have form within a modal and you fill out all the fields.
As soon as you save any changes to the code, traditional live reload would hard refresh the page causing all of those fields to be reset.
Every time you make a change, you'd have to open up the modal _again_ and fill out the form _again_.

But with HMR, all of that state is preserved _across updates_.

## React Fast Refresh

React already has mechanisms for updating the DOM via its [virtual DOM][virtual-dom] in response to user interactions like clicking a button.
Wouldn't it be great if React could handle updating the DOM in response to code changes too?

That's exactly what [React Fast Refresh][react-refresh] is all about!
Of course, React is all about components, not general JavaScript code, so React Fast Refresh only handles hot updates for exported React components.

But React Fast Refresh does have some limitations that you should be aware of.

### Class Component State

React Fast Refresh does not preserve state for class components.
This includes higher-order components that internally return classes:

```tsx
export class ComponentA extends Component {} // ❌

export const ComponentB = HOC(ComponentC); // ❌ Won't work if HOC returns a class component

export function ComponentD() {} // ✅
export const ComponentE = () => {}; // ✅
export default function ComponentF() {} // ✅
```

### Named Function Components

Function components must be named, not anonymous, for React Fast Refresh to track changes:

```tsx
export default () => {}; // ❌
export default function () {} // ❌

const ComponentA = () => {};
export default ComponentA; // ✅

export default function ComponentB() {} // ✅
```

### Supported Exports

React Fast Refresh can only handle component exports. While React Router manages [route exports like `action`, ` headers`, `links`, `loader`, and `meta`][route-module] for you, any user-defined exports will cause full reloads:

```tsx
// These exports are handled by the React Router Vite plugin
// to be HMR-compatible
export const meta = { title: "Home" }; // ✅
export const links = [
  { rel: "stylesheet", href: "style.css" },
]; // ✅

// These exports are removed by the React Router Vite plugin
// so they never affect HMR
export const headers = { "Cache-Control": "max-age=3600" }; // ✅
export const loader = async () => {}; // ✅
export const action = async () => {}; // ✅

// This is not a route module export, nor a component export,
// so it will cause a full reload for this route
export const myValue = "some value"; // ❌

export default function Route() {} // ✅
```

👆 Routes probably shouldn't be exporting random values like that anyway.
If you want to reuse values across routes, stick them in their own non-route module:

```ts filename=my-custom-value.ts
export const myValue = "some value";
```

### Changing Hooks

React Fast Refresh cannot track changes for a component when hooks are being added or removed from it, causing full reloads just for the next render. After the hooks have been updated, changes should result in hot updates again. For example, if you add a `useState` to your component, you may lose that component's local state for the next render.

Additionally, if you are destructuring a hook's return value, React Fast Refresh will not be able to preserve state for the component if the destructured key is removed or renamed.
For example:

```tsx
export default function Component({ loaderData }) {
  const { pet } = useMyCustomHook();
  return (
    <div>
      <input />
      <p>My dog's name is {pet.name}!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

If you change the key `pet` to `dog`:

```diff
 export default function Component() {
-  const { pet } = useMyCustomHook();
+  const { dog } = useMyCustomHook();
   return (
     <div>
       <input />
-      <p>My dog's name is {pet.name}!</p>
+      <p>My dog's name is {dog.name}!</p>
     </div>
   );
 }
```

then React Fast Refresh will not be able to preserve state `<input />` ❌.

### Component Keys

In some cases, React cannot distinguish between existing components being changed and new components being added. [React needs `key`s][react-keys] to disambiguate these cases and track changes when sibling elements are modified.

title: Type Safety

# Type Safety

If you haven't done so already, check out our guide for [setting up type safety][route-module-type-safety] in a new project.

React Router generates types for each route in your app to provide type safety for the route module exports.

For example, let's say you have a `products/:id` route configured:

```ts filename=app/routes.ts
import {
  type RouteConfig,
  route,
} from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
  route("products/:id", "./routes/product.tsx"),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

You can import route-specific types like so:

```tsx filename=app/routes/product.tsx
import type { Route } from "./+types/product";
// types generated for this route 👆

export function loader({ params }: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  //                      👆 { id: string }
  return { planet: `world #${params.id}` };
}

export default function Component({
  loaderData, // 👈 { planet: string }
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  return <h1>Hello, {loaderData.planet}!</h1>;
}
```

## How it works

React Router's type generation executes your route config (`app/routes.ts` by default) to determine the routes for your app.
It then generates a `+types/<route file>.d.ts` for each route within a special `.react-router/types/` directory.
With [`rootDirs` configured][route-module-type-safety], TypeScript can import these generated files as if they were right next to their corresponding route modules.

For a deeper dive into some of the design decisions, check out our [type inference decision doc](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/dev/decisions/0012-type-inference.md).

[route-module-type-safety]: ../how-to/route-module-type-safety

## `typegen` command

You can manually generate types with the `typegen` command:

```sh
react-router typegen
```

The following types are generated for each route:

- `LoaderArgs`
- `ClientLoaderArgs`
- `ActionArgs`
- `ClientActionArgs`
- `HydrateFallbackProps`
- `ComponentProps` (for the `default` export)
- `ErrorBoundaryProps`

### --watch

If you run `react-router dev` — or if your custom server calls `vite.createServer` — then React Router's Vite plugin is already generating up-to-date types for you.
But if you really need to run type generation on its own, you can also use `--watch` to automatically regenerate types as files change:

```sh
react-router typegen --watch
```

# Routing

[MODES: framework]

## Configuring Routes

Routes are configured in `app/routes.ts`. Each route has two required parts: a URL pattern to match the URL, and a file path to the route module that defines its behavior.

```ts filename=app/routes.ts
import {
  type RouteConfig,
  route,
} from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
  route("some/path", "./some/file.tsx"),
  // pattern ^           ^ module file
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

Here is a larger sample route config:

```ts filename=app/routes.ts
import {
  type RouteConfig,
  route,
  index,
  layout,
  prefix,
} from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
  index("./home.tsx"),
  route("about", "./about.tsx"),

  layout("./auth/layout.tsx", [
    route("login", "./auth/login.tsx"),
    route("register", "./auth/register.tsx"),
  ]),

  ...prefix("concerts", [
    index("./concerts/home.tsx"),
    route(":city", "./concerts/city.tsx"),
    route("trending", "./concerts/trending.tsx"),
  ]),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

If you prefer to define your routes via file naming conventions rather than configuration, the `@react-router/fs-routes` package provides a [file system routing convention][file-route-conventions]. You can even combine different routing conventions if you like:

```ts filename=app/routes.ts
import {
  type RouteConfig,
  route,
} from "@react-router/dev/routes";
import { flatRoutes } from "@react-router/fs-routes";

export default [
  route("/", "./home.tsx"),

  ...(await flatRoutes()),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

## Route Modules

The files referenced in `routes.ts` define each route's behavior:

```tsx filename=app/routes.ts
route("teams/:teamId", "./team.tsx"),
//           route module ^^^^^^^^
```

Here's a sample route module:

```tsx filename=app/team.tsx
// provides type safety/inference
import type { Route } from "./+types/team";

// provides `loaderData` to the component
export async function loader({ params }: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  let team = await fetchTeam(params.teamId);
  return { name: team.name };
}

// renders after the loader is done
export default function Component({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  return <h1>{loaderData.name}</h1>;
}
```

Route modules have more features like actions, headers, and error boundaries, but they will be covered in the next guide: [Route Modules](./route-module)

## Nested Routes

Routes can be nested inside parent routes.

```ts filename=app/routes.ts
import {
  type RouteConfig,
  route,
  index,
} from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
  // parent route
  route("dashboard", "./dashboard.tsx", [
    // child routes
    index("./home.tsx"),
    route("settings", "./settings.tsx"),
  ]),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

The path of the parent is automatically included in the child, so this config creates both `"/dashboard"` and `"/dashboard/settings"` URLs.

Child routes are rendered through the `<Outlet/>` in the parent route.

```tsx filename=app/dashboard.tsx
import { Outlet } from "react-router";

export default function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      {/* will either be home.tsx or settings.tsx */}
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Root Route

Every route in `routes.ts` is nested inside the special `app/root.tsx` module.

## Layout Routes

Using `layout`, layout routes create new nesting for their children, but they don't add any segments to the URL. It's like the root route but they can be added at any level.

```tsx filename=app/routes.ts lines=[10,16]
import {
  type RouteConfig,
  route,
  layout,
  index,
  prefix,
} from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
  layout("./marketing/layout.tsx", [
    index("./marketing/home.tsx"),
    route("contact", "./marketing/contact.tsx"),
  ]),
  ...prefix("projects", [
    index("./projects/home.tsx"),
    layout("./projects/project-layout.tsx", [
      route(":pid", "./projects/project.tsx"),
      route(":pid/edit", "./projects/edit-project.tsx"),
    ]),
  ]),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

Note that:

- `home.tsx` and `contact.tsx` will be rendered into the `marketing/layout.tsx` outlet without creating any new URL paths
- `project.tsx` and `edit-project.tsx` will be rendered into the `projects/project-layout.tsx` outlet at `/projects/:pid` and `/projects/:pid/edit` while `projects/home.tsx` will not.

## Index Routes

```ts
index(componentFile),
```

Index routes render into their parent's [Outlet][outlet] at their parent's URL (like a default child route).

```ts filename=app/routes.ts
import {
  type RouteConfig,
  route,
  index,
} from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
  // renders into the root.tsx Outlet at /
  index("./home.tsx"),
  route("dashboard", "./dashboard.tsx", [
    // renders into the dashboard.tsx Outlet at /dashboard
    index("./dashboard-home.tsx"),
    route("settings", "./dashboard-settings.tsx"),
  ]),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

Note that index routes can't have children.

## Route Prefixes

Using `prefix`, you can add a path prefix to a set of routes without needing to introduce a parent route file.

```tsx filename=app/routes.ts lines=[14]
import {
  type RouteConfig,
  route,
  layout,
  index,
  prefix,
} from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
  layout("./marketing/layout.tsx", [
    index("./marketing/home.tsx"),
    route("contact", "./marketing/contact.tsx"),
  ]),
  ...prefix("projects", [
    index("./projects/home.tsx"),
    layout("./projects/project-layout.tsx", [
      route(":pid", "./projects/project.tsx"),
      route(":pid/edit", "./projects/edit-project.tsx"),
    ]),
  ]),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

## Dynamic Segments

If a path segment starts with `:` then it becomes a "dynamic segment". When the route matches the URL, the dynamic segment will be parsed from the URL and provided as `params` to other router APIs.

```ts filename=app/routes.ts
route("teams/:teamId", "./team.tsx"),
```

```tsx filename=app/team.tsx
import type { Route } from "./+types/team";

export async function loader({ params }: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  //                           ^? { teamId: string }
}

export default function Component({
  params,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  params.teamId;
  //        ^ string
}
```

You can have multiple dynamic segments in one route path:

```ts filename=app/routes.ts
route("c/:categoryId/p/:productId", "./product.tsx"),
```

```tsx filename=app/product.tsx
import type { Route } from "./+types/product";

async function loader({ params }: LoaderArgs) {
  //                    ^? { categoryId: string; productId: string }
}
```

## Optional Segments

You can make a route segment optional by adding a `?` to the end of the segment.

```ts filename=app/routes.ts
route(":lang?/categories", "./categories.tsx"),
```

You can have optional static segments, too:

```ts filename=app/routes.ts
route("users/:userId/edit?", "./user.tsx");
```

## Splats

Also known as "catchall" and "star" segments. If a route path pattern ends with `/*` then it will match any characters following the `/`, including other `/` characters.

```ts filename=app/routes.ts
route("files/*", "./files.tsx"),
```

```tsx filename=app/files.tsx
export async function loader({ params }: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  // params["*"] will contain the remaining URL after files/
}
```

You can destructure the `*`, you just have to assign it a new name. A common name is `splat`:

```tsx
const { "*": splat } = params;
```

## Component Routes

You can also use components that match the URL to elements anywhere in the component tree:

```tsx
import { Routes, Route } from "react-router";

function Wizard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Some Wizard with Steps</h1>
      <Routes>
        <Route index element={<StepOne />} />
        <Route path="step-2" element={<StepTwo />} />
        <Route path="step-3" element={<StepThree />} />
      </Routes>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Note that these routes do not participate in data loading, actions, code splitting, or any other route module features, so their use cases are more limited than those of the route module.

# Route Module

[MODES: framework]

## Introduction

The files referenced in `routes.ts` are called Route Modules.

```tsx filename=app/routes.ts
route("teams/:teamId", "./team.tsx"),
//           route module ^^^^^^^^
```

Route modules are the foundation of React Router's framework features, they define:

- automatic code-splitting
- data loading
- actions
- revalidation
- error boundaries
- and more

This guide is a quick overview of every route module feature. The rest of the getting started guides will cover these features in more detail.

## Component (`default`)

The `default` export in a route module defines the component that will render when the route matches.

```tsx filename=app/routes/my-route.tsx
export default function MyRouteComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Look ma!</h1>
      <p>
        I'm still using React Router after like 10 years.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Props passed to the Component

When the component is rendered, it is provided the props defined in `Route.ComponentProps` that React Router will automatically generate for you. These props include:

1. `loaderData`: The data returned from the `loader` function in this route module
2. `actionData`: The data returned from the `action` function in this route module
3. `params`: An object containing the route parameters (if any).
4. `matches`: An array of all the matches in the current route tree.

You can use these props in place of hooks like `useLoaderData` or `useParams`. This may be preferrable because they will be automatically typed correctly for the route.

### Using props

```tsx filename=app/routes/my-route-with-default-params.tsx
import type { Route } from "./+types/route-name";

export default function MyRouteComponent({
  loaderData,
  actionData,
  params,
  matches,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My Route with Props!</h1>
      <p>Loader Data: {JSON.stringify(loaderData)}</p>
      <p>Action Data: {JSON.stringify(actionData)}</p>
      <p>Route Parameters: {JSON.stringify(params)}</p>
      <p>Matched Routes: {JSON.stringify(matches)}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## `loader`

Route loaders provide data to route components before they are rendered. They are only called on the server when server rendering or during the build with pre-rendering.

```tsx
export async function loader() {
  return { message: "Hello, world!" };
}

export default function MyRoute({ loaderData }) {
  return <h1>{loaderData.message}</h1>;
}
```

See also:

- [`loader` params][loader-params]

## `clientLoader`

Called only in the browser, route client loaders provide data to route components in addition to, or in place of, route loaders.

```tsx
export async function clientLoader({ serverLoader }) {
  // call the server loader
  const serverData = await serverLoader();
  // And/or fetch data on the client
  const data = getDataFromClient();
  // Return the data to expose through useLoaderData()
  return data;
}
```

Client loaders can participate in initial page load hydration of server rendered pages by setting the `hydrate` property on the function:

```tsx
export async function clientLoader() {
  // ...
}
clientLoader.hydrate = true as const;
```

<docs-info>

By using `as const`, TypeScript will infer that the type for `clientLoader.hydrate` is `true` instead of `boolean`.
That way, React Router can derive types for `loaderData` based on the value of `clientLoader.hydrate`.

</docs-info>

- [`clientLoader` params][client-loader-params]

## `action`

Route actions allow server-side data mutations with automatic revalidation of all loader data on the page when called from `<Form>`, `useFetcher`, and `useSubmit`.

```tsx
// route("/list", "./list.tsx")
import { Form } from "react-router";
import { TodoList } from "~/components/TodoList";

// this data will be loaded after the action completes...
export async function loader() {
  const items = await fakeDb.getItems();
  return { items };
}

// ...so that the list here is updated automatically
export default function Items({ loaderData }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <List items={loaderData.items} />
      <Form method="post" navigate={false} action="/list">
        <input type="text" name="title" />
        <button type="submit">Create Todo</button>
      </Form>
    </div>
  );
}

export async function action({ request }) {
  const data = await request.formData();
  const todo = await fakeDb.addItem({
    title: data.get("title"),
  });
  return { ok: true };
}
```

## `clientAction`

Like route actions but only called in the browser.

```tsx
export async function clientAction({ serverAction }) {
  fakeInvalidateClientSideCache();
  // can still call the server action if needed
  const data = await serverAction();
  return data;
}
```

See also:

- [`clientAction` params][client-action-params]

## `ErrorBoundary`

When other route module APIs throw, the route module `ErrorBoundary` will render instead of the route component.

```tsx
import {
  isRouteErrorResponse,
  useRouteError,
} from "react-router";

export function ErrorBoundary() {
  const error = useRouteError();

  if (isRouteErrorResponse(error)) {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>
          {error.status} {error.statusText}
        </h1>
        <p>{error.data}</p>
      </div>
    );
  } else if (error instanceof Error) {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Error</h1>
        <p>{error.message}</p>
        <p>The stack trace is:</p>
        <pre>{error.stack}</pre>
      </div>
    );
  } else {
    return <h1>Unknown Error</h1>;
  }
}
```

## `HydrateFallback`

On initial page load, the route component renders only after the client loader is finished. If exported, a `HydrateFallback` can render immediately in place of the route component.

```tsx filename=routes/client-only-route.tsx
export async function clientLoader() {
  const data = await fakeLoadLocalGameData();
  return data;
}

export function HydrateFallback() {
  return <p>Loading Game...</p>;
}

export default function Component({ loaderData }) {
  return <Game data={loaderData} />;
}
```

## `headers`

Route headers define HTTP headers to be sent with the response when server rendering.

```tsx
export function headers() {
  return {
    "X-Stretchy-Pants": "its for fun",
    "Cache-Control": "max-age=300, s-maxage=3600",
  };
}
```

## `handle`

Route handle allows apps to add anything to a route match in `useMatches` to create abstractions (like breadcrumbs, etc.).

```tsx
export const handle = {
  its: "all yours",
};
```

## `links`

Route links define [`<link>` element][link-element]s to be rendered in the document `<head>`.

```tsx
export function links() {
  return [
    {
      rel: "icon",
      href: "/favicon.png",
      type: "image/png",
    },
    {
      rel: "stylesheet",
      href: "https://example.com/some/styles.css",
    },
    {
      rel: "preload",
      href: "/images/banner.jpg",
      as: "image",
    },
  ];
}
```

All routes links will be aggregated and rendered through the `<Links />` component, usually rendered in your app root:

```tsx
import { Links } from "react-router";

export default function Root() {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <Links />
      </head>

      <body />
    </html>
  );
}
```

## `meta`

Route meta defines meta tags to be rendered in the `<head>` of the document.

```tsx
export function meta() {
  return [
    { title: "Very cool app" },
    {
      property: "og:title",
      content: "Very cool app",
    },
    {
      name: "description",
      content: "This app is the best",
    },
  ];
}
```

All routes' meta will be aggregated and rendered through the `<Meta />` component, usually rendered in your app root:

```tsx
import { Meta } from "react-router";

export default function Root() {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <Meta />
      </head>

      <body />
    </html>
  );
}
```

**See also**

- [`meta` params][meta-params]

## `shouldRevalidate`

By default, all routes are revalidated after actions. This function allows a route to opt-out of revalidation for actions that don't affect its data.

```tsx
import type { ShouldRevalidateFunctionArgs } from "react-router";

export function shouldRevalidate(
  arg: ShouldRevalidateFunctionArgs
) {
  return true;
}
```

# Testing

[MODES: framework]

## Introduction

When components use things like `useLoaderData`, `<Link>`, etc, they are required to be rendered in context of a React Router app. The `createRoutesStub` function creates that context to test components in isolation.

Consider a login form component that relies on `useActionData`

```tsx
import { useActionData } from "react-router";

export function LoginForm() {
  const { errors } = useActionData();
  return (
    <Form method="post">
      <label>
        <input type="text" name="username" />
        {errors?.username && <div>{errors.username}</div>}
      </label>

      <label>
        <input type="password" name="password" />
        {errors?.password && <div>{errors.password}</div>}
      </label>

      <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

We can test this component with `createRoutesStub`. It takes an array of objects that resemble route modules with loaders, actions, and components.

```tsx
import { createRoutesStub } from "react-router";
import {
  render,
  screen,
  waitFor,
} from "@testing-library/react";
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event";
import { LoginForm } from "./LoginForm";

test("LoginForm renders error messages", async () => {
  const USER_MESSAGE = "Username is required";
  const PASSWORD_MESSAGE = "Password is required";

  const Stub = createRoutesStub([
    {
      path: "/login",
      Component: LoginForm,
      action() {
        return {
          errors: {
            username: USER_MESSAGE,
            password: PASSWORD_MESSAGE,
          },
        };
      },
    },
  ]);

  // render the app stub at "/login"
  render(<Stub initialEntries={["/login"]} />);

  // simulate interactions
  userEvent.click(screen.getByText("Login"));
  await waitFor(() => screen.findByText(USER_MESSAGE));
  await waitFor(() => screen.findByText(PASSWORD_MESSAGE));
});
```

[View it live →](#TODO)

### Manual Fullstack Deployment

If you want to deploy to your own server or a different hosting provider, see the [Manual Deployment](../how-to/manual-deployment) guide.

## Static Hosting

React Router doesn't require a server and can run on any static hosting provider.

### Popular Static Hosting Providers

You can get started with the following Deploy Now buttons:

[![Deploy SPA Cloudflare][cloudflare_button]][cloudflare_spa]

[![Deploy Netlify SPA][netlify_button]][netlify_spa]

[![Deploy Vercel SPA][vercel_button]][vercel_spa]

### Manual Static Hosting

Ensure the `ssr` flag is `false` in your Vite config:

```ts
import react from "@react-router/dev/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react({ ssr: false })],
});
```

Build the app:

```shellscript
npx vite build
```

And then deploy the `build/client` folder to any static host.

You'll need to ensure that all requests are routed to `index.html`. This is different with every host/server, so you'll need to find out how with your host/server.

# Pending UI

[MODES: framework]

## Introduction

When the user navigates to a new route, or submits data to an action, the UI should immediately respond to the user's actions with a pending or optimistic state. Application code is responsible for this.

## Global Pending Navigation

When the user navigates to a new url, the loaders for the next page are awaited before the next page renders. You can get the pending state from `useNavigation`.

```tsx
import { useNavigation } from "react-router";

export default function Root() {
  const navigation = useNavigation();
  const isNavigating = Boolean(navigation.location);

  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        {isNavigating && <GlobalSpinner />}
        <Outlet />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Local Pending Navigation

Pending indicators can also be localized to the link. NavLink's children, className, and style props can be functions that receive the pending state.

```tsx
import { NavLink } from "react-router";

function Navbar() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <NavLink to="/home">
        {({ isPending }) => (
          <span>Home {isPending && <Spinner />}</span>
        )}
      </NavLink>
      <NavLink
        to="/about"
        style={({ isPending }) => ({
          color: isPending ? "gray" : "black",
        })}
      >
        About
      </NavLink>
    </nav>
  );
}
```

## Pending Form Submission

When a form is submitted, the UI should immediately respond to the user's actions with a pending state. This is easiest to do with a [fetcher][use_fetcher] form because it has it's own independent state (whereas normal forms cause a global navigation).

```tsx filename=app/project.tsx lines=[10-12]
import { useFetcher } from "react-router";

function NewProjectForm() {
  const fetcher = useFetcher();

  return (
    <fetcher.Form method="post">
      <input type="text" name="title" />
      <button type="submit">
        {fetcher.state !== "idle"
          ? "Submitting..."
          : "Submit"}
      </button>
    </fetcher.Form>
  );
}
```

For non-fetcher form submissions, pending states are available on `useNavigation`.

```tsx filename=app/projects/new.tsx
import { useNavigation, Form } from "react-router";

function NewProjectForm() {
  const navigation = useNavigation();

  return (
    <Form method="post" action="/projects/new">
      <input type="text" name="title" />
      <button type="submit">
        {navigation.formAction === "/projects/new"
          ? "Submitting..."
          : "Submit"}
      </button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

## Optimistic UI

When the future state of the UI is known by the form submission data, an optimistic UI can be implemented for instant UX.

```tsx filename=app/project.tsx lines=[4-7]
function Task({ task }) {
  const fetcher = useFetcher();

  let isComplete = task.status === "complete";
  if (fetcher.formData) {
    isComplete =
      fetcher.formData.get("status") === "complete";
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{task.title}</div>
      <fetcher.Form method="post">
        <button
          name="status"
          value={isComplete ? "incomplete" : "complete"}
        >
          {isComplete ? "Mark Incomplete" : "Mark Complete"}
        </button>
      </fetcher.Form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Rendering Strategies

[MODES: framework]

## Introduction

There are three rendering strategies in React Router:

- Client Side Rendering
- Server Side Rendering
- Static Pre-rendering

## Client Side Rendering

Routes are always client side rendered as the user navigates around the app. If you're looking to build a Single Page App, disable server rendering:

```ts filename=react-router.config.ts
import type { Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";

export default {
  ssr: false,
} satisfies Config;
```

## Server Side Rendering

```ts filename=react-router.config.ts
import type { Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";

export default {
  ssr: true,
} satisfies Config;
```

Server side rendering requires a deployment that supports it. Though it's a global setting, individual routes can still be statically pre-rendered. Routes can also use client data loading with `clientLoader` to avoid server rendering/fetching for their portion of the UI.

## Static Pre-rendering

```ts filename=react-router.config.ts
import type { Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";

export default {
  // return a list of URLs to prerender at build time
  async prerender() {
    return ["/", "/about", "/contact"];
  },
} satisfies Config;
```

Pre-rendering is a build-time operation that generates static HTML and client navigation data payloads for a list of URLs. This is useful for SEO and performance, especially for deployments without server rendering. When pre-rendering, route module loaders are used to fetch data at build time.

# Data Loading

[MODES: framework]

## Introduction

Data is provided to the route component from `loader` and `clientLoader`.

Loader data is automatically serialized from loaders and deserialized in components. In addition to primitive values like strings and numbers, loaders can return promises, maps, sets, dates and more.

The type for the `loaderData` prop is [automatically generated][type-safety].

## Client Data Loading

`clientLoader` is used to fetch data on the client. This is useful for pages or full projects that you'd prefer to fetch data from the browser only.

```tsx filename=app/product.tsx
// route("products/:pid", "./product.tsx");
import type { Route } from "./+types/product";

export async function clientLoader({
  params,
}: Route.ClientLoaderArgs) {
  const res = await fetch(`/api/products/${params.pid}`);
  const product = await res.json();
  return product;
}

// HydrateFallback is rendered while the client loader is running
export function HydrateFallback() {
  return <div>Loading...</div>;
}

export default function Product({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  const { name, description } = loaderData;
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{name}</h1>
      <p>{description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Server Data Loading

When server rendering, `loader` is used for both initial page loads and client navigations. Client navigations call the loader through an automatic `fetch` by React Router from the browser to your server.

```tsx filename=app/product.tsx
// route("products/:pid", "./product.tsx");
import type { Route } from "./+types/product";
import { fakeDb } from "../db";

export async function loader({ params }: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const product = await fakeDb.getProduct(params.pid);
  return product;
}

export default function Product({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  const { name, description } = loaderData;
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{name}</h1>
      <p>{description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Note that the `loader` function is removed from client bundles so you can use server only APIs without worrying about them being included in the browser.

## Static Data Loading

When pre-rendering, loaders are used to fetch data during the production build.

```tsx filename=app/product.tsx
// route("products/:pid", "./product.tsx");
import type { Route } from "./+types/product";

export async function loader({ params }: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  let product = await getProductFromCSVFile(params.pid);
  return product;
}

export default function Product({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  const { name, description } = loaderData;
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{name}</h1>
      <p>{description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The URLs to pre-render are specified in react-router.config.ts:

```ts filename=react-router.config.ts
import type { Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";

export default {
  async prerender() {
    let products = await readProductsFromCSVFile();
    return products.map(
      (product) => `/products/${product.id}`
    );
  },
} satisfies Config;
```

Note that when server rendering, any URLs that aren't pre-rendered will be server rendered as usual, allowing you to pre-render some data at a single route while still server rendering the rest.

## Using Both Loaders

`loader` and `clientLoader` can be used together. The `loader` will be used on the server for initial SSR (or pre-rendering) and the `clientLoader` will be used on subsequent client-side navigations.

```tsx filename=app/product.tsx
// route("products/:pid", "./product.tsx");
import type { Route } from "./+types/product";
import { fakeDb } from "../db";

export async function loader({ params }: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  return fakeDb.getProduct(params.pid);
}

export async function clientLoader({
  serverLoader,
  params,
}: Route.ClientLoaderArgs) {
  const res = await fetch(`/api/products/${params.pid}`);
  const serverData = await serverLoader();
  return { ...serverData, ...res.json() };
}

export default function Product({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  const { name, description } = loaderData;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{name}</h1>
      <p>{description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

You can also force the client loader to run during hydration and before the page renders by setting the `hydrate` property on the function. In this situation you will want to render a `HydrateFallback` component to show a fallback UI while the client loader runs.

```tsx filename=app/product.tsx
export async function loader() {
  /* ... */
}

export async function clientLoader() {
  /* ... */
}

// force the client loader to run during hydration
clientLoader.hydrate = true as const; // `as const` for type inference

export function HydrateFallback() {
  return <div>Loading...</div>;
}

export default function Product() {
  /* ... */
}
```

# Navigating

[MODES: framework]

## Introduction

Users navigate your application with `<Link>`, `<NavLink>`, `<Form>`, `redirect`, and `useNavigate`.

## NavLink

This component is for navigation links that need to render active and pending states.

```tsx
import { NavLink } from "react-router";

export function MyAppNav() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <NavLink to="/" end>
        Home
      </NavLink>
      <NavLink to="/trending" end>
        Trending Concerts
      </NavLink>
      <NavLink to="/concerts">All Concerts</NavLink>
      <NavLink to="/account">Account</NavLink>
    </nav>
  );
}
```

`NavLink` renders default class names for different states for easy styling with CSS:

```css
a.active {
  color: red;
}

a.pending {
  animate: pulse 1s infinite;
}

a.transitioning {
  /* css transition is running */
}
```

It also has callback props on `className`, `style`, and `children` with the states for inline styling or conditional rendering:

```tsx
// className
<NavLink
  to="/messages"
  className={({ isActive, isPending, isTransitioning }) =>
    [
      isPending ? "pending" : "",
      isActive ? "active" : "",
      isTransitioning ? "transitioning" : "",
    ].join(" ")
  }

</NavLink>
```

```tsx
// style
<NavLink
  to="/messages"
  style={({ isActive, isPending, isTransitioning }) => {
    return {
      fontWeight: isActive ? "bold" : "",
      color: isPending ? "red" : "black",
      viewTransitionName: isTransitioning ? "slide" : "",
    };
  }}
>
  Messages
</NavLink>
```

```tsx
// children
<NavLink to="/tasks">
  {({ isActive, isPending, isTransitioning }) => (
    <span className={isActive ? "active" : ""}>Tasks</span>
  )}
</NavLink>
```

## Link

Use `<Link>` when the link doesn't need active styling:

```tsx
import { Link } from "react-router";

export function LoggedOutMessage() {
  return (
    <p>
      You've been logged out.{" "}
      <Link to="/login">Login again</Link>
    </p>
  );
}
```

## Form

The form component can be used to navigate with `URLSearchParams` provided by the user.

```tsx
<Form action="/search">
  <input type="text" name="q" />
</Form>
```

If the user enters "journey" into the input and submits it, they will navigate to:

```
/search?q=journey
```

Forms with `<Form method="post" />` will also navigate to the action prop but will submit the data as `FormData` instead of `URLSearchParams`. However, it is more common to `useFetcher()` to POST form data. See [Using Fetchers](../../how-to/fetchers).

## redirect

Inside of route loaders and actions, you can return a `redirect` to another URL.

```tsx
import { redirect } from "react-router";

export async function loader({ request }) {
  let user = await getUser(request);
  if (!user) {
    return redirect("/login");
  }
  return { userName: user.name };
}
```

It is common to redirect to a new record after it has been created:

```tsx
import { redirect } from "react-router";

export async function action({ request }) {
  let formData = await request.formData();
  let project = await createProject(formData);
  return redirect(`/projects/${project.id}`);
}
```

## useNavigate

This hook allows the programmer to navigate the user to a new page without the user interacting. Usage of this hook should be uncommon. It's recommended to use the other APIs in this guide when possible.

Reserve usage of `useNavigate` to situations where the user is _not_ interacting but you need to navigate, for example:

- Logging them out after inactivity
- Timed UIs like quizzes, etc.

```tsx
import { useNavigate } from "react-router";

export function useLogoutAfterInactivity() {
  let navigate = useNavigate();

  useFakeInactivityHook(() => {
    navigate("/logout");
  });
}
```

# Actions

[MODES: framework]

## Introduction

Data mutations are done through Route actions. When the action completes, all loader data on the page is revalidated to keep your UI in sync with the data without writing any code to do it.

Route actions defined with `action` are only called on the server while actions defined with `clientAction` are run in the browser.

## Client Actions

Client actions only run in the browser and take priority over a server action when both are defined.

```tsx filename=app/project.tsx
// route('/projects/:projectId', './project.tsx')
import type { Route } from "./+types/project";
import { Form } from "react-router";
import { someApi } from "./api";

export async function clientAction({
  request,
}: Route.ClientActionArgs) {
  let formData = await request.formData();
  let title = formData.get("title");
  let project = await someApi.updateProject({ title });
  return project;
}

export default function Project({
  actionData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Project</h1>
      <Form method="post">
        <input type="text" name="title" />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </Form>
      {actionData ? (
        <p>{actionData.title} updated</p>
      ) : null}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Server Actions

Server actions only run on the server and are removed from client bundles.

```tsx filename=app/project.tsx
// route('/projects/:projectId', './project.tsx')
import type { Route } from "./+types/project";
import { Form } from "react-router";
import { fakeDb } from "../db";

export async function action({
  request,
}: Route.ActionArgs) {
  let formData = await request.formData();
  let title = formData.get("title");
  let project = await fakeDb.updateProject({ title });
  return project;
}

export default function Project({
  actionData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Project</h1>
      <Form method="post">
        <input type="text" name="title" />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </Form>
      {actionData ? (
        <p>{actionData.title} updated</p>
      ) : null}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Calling Actions

Actions are called declaratively through `<Form>` and imperatively through `useSubmit` (or `<fetcher.Form>` and `fetcher.submit`) by referencing the route's path and a "post" method.

### Calling actions with a Form

```tsx
import { Form } from "react-router";

function SomeComponent() {
  return (
    <Form action="/projects/123" method="post">
      <input type="text" name="title" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

This will cause a navigation and a new entry will be added to the browser history.

### Calling actions with useSubmit

You can submit form data to an action imperatively with `useSubmit`.

```tsx
import { useCallback } from "react";
import { useSubmit } from "react-router";
import { useFakeTimer } from "fake-lib";

function useQuizTimer() {
  let submit = useSubmit();

  let cb = useCallback(() => {
    submit(
      { quizTimedOut: true },
      { action: "/end-quiz", method: "post" }
    );
  }, []);

  let tenMinutes = 10 * 60 * 1000;
  useFakeTimer(tenMinutes, cb);
}
```

This will cause a navigation and a new entry will be added to the browser history.

### Calling actions with a fetcher

Fetchers allow you to submit data to actions (and loaders) without causing a navigation (no new entries in the browser history).

```tsx
import { useFetcher } from "react-router";

function Task() {
  let fetcher = useFetcher();
  let busy = fetcher.state !== "idle";

  return (
    <fetcher.Form method="post" action="/update-task/123">
      <input type="text" name="title" />
      <button type="submit">
        {busy ? "Saving..." : "Save"}
      </button>
    </fetcher.Form>
  );
}
```

They also have the imperative `submit` method.

```tsx
fetcher.submit(
  { title: "New Title" },
  { action: "/update-task/123", method: "post" }
);
```

See the [Using Fetchers][fetchers] guide for more information.

# Installation

[MODES: framework]

## Introduction

Most projects start with a template. Let's use a basic template maintained by React Router:

```shellscript nonumber
npx create-react-router@latest my-react-router-app
```

Now change into the new directory and start the app

```shellscript nonumber
cd my-react-router-app
npm i
npm run dev
```

You can now open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

You can [view the template on GitHub][default-template] to see how to manually set up your project.

We also have a number of [ready to deploy templates][react-router-templates] available for you to get started with:

```shellscript nonumber
npx create-react-router@latest --template remix-run/react-router-templates/<template-name>
```

# Routing

[MODES: declarative]

## Configuring Routes

Routes are configured by rendering `<Routes>` and `<Route>` that couple URL segments to UI elements.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router";
import App from "./app";

const root = document.getElementById("root");

ReactDOM.createRoot(root).render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<App />} />
    </Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>
);
```

Here's a larger sample config:

```tsx
<Routes>
  <Route index element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="about" element={<About />} />

  <Route element={<AuthLayout />}>
    <Route path="login" element={<Login />} />
    <Route path="register" element={<Register />} />
  </Route>

  <Route path="concerts">
    <Route index element={<ConcertsHome />} />
    <Route path=":city" element={<City />} />
    <Route path="trending" element={<Trending />} />
  </Route>
</Routes>
```

## Nested Routes

Routes can be nested inside parent routes.

```tsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="dashboard" element={<Dashboard />}>
    <Route index element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="settings" element={<Settings />} />
  </Route>
</Routes>
```

The path of the parent is automatically included in the child, so this config creates both `"/dashboard"` and `"/dashboard/settings"` URLs.

Child routes are rendered through the `<Outlet/>` in the parent route.

```tsx filename=app/dashboard.tsx
import { Outlet } from "react-router";

export default function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      {/* will either be <Home/> or <Settings/> */}
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Layout Routes

Routes _without_ a `path` create new nesting for their children, but they don't add any segments to the URL.

```tsx lines=[2,9]
<Routes>
  <Route element={<MarketingLayout />}>
    <Route index element={<MarketingHome />} />
    <Route path="contact" element={<Contact />} />
  </Route>

  <Route path="projects">
    <Route index element={<ProjectsHome />} />
    <Route element={<ProjectsLayout />}>
      <Route path=":pid" element={<Project />} />
      <Route path=":pid/edit" element={<EditProject />} />
    </Route>
  </Route>
</Routes>
```

## Index Routes

Index routes render into their parent's `<Outlet/>` at their parent's URL (like a default child route). They are configured with the `index` prop:

```tsx lines=[4,8]
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Root />}>
    {/* renders into the outlet in <Root> at "/" */}
    <Route index element={<Home />} />

    <Route path="dashboard" element={<Dashboard />}>
      {/* renders into the outlet in <Dashboard> at "/dashboard" */}
      <Route index element={<DashboardHome />} />
      <Route path="settings" element={<Settings />} />
    </Route>
  </Route>
</Routes>
```

Note that index routes can't have children. If you're expecting that behavior, you probably want a [layout route](#layout-routes).

## Route Prefixes

A `<Route path>` _without_ an `element` prop adds a path prefix to its child routes, without introducing a parent layout.

```tsx filename=app/routes.ts lines=[1]
<Route path="projects">
  <Route index element={<ProjectsHome />} />
  <Route element={<ProjectsLayout />}>
    <Route path=":pid" element={<Project />} />
    <Route path=":pid/edit" element={<EditProject />} />
  </Route>
</Route>
```

## Dynamic Segments

If a path segment starts with `:` then it becomes a "dynamic segment". When the route matches the URL, the dynamic segment will be parsed from the URL and provided as `params` to other router APIs like `useParams`.

```tsx
<Route path="teams/:teamId" element={<Team />} />
```

```tsx filename=app/team.tsx
import { useParams } from "react-router";

export default function Team() {
  let params = useParams();
  // params.teamId
}
```

You can have multiple dynamic segments in one route path:

```tsx
<Route
  path="/c/:categoryId/p/:productId"
  element={<Product />}
/>
```

```tsx filename=app/category-product.tsx
import { useParams } from "react-router";

export default function CategoryProduct() {
  let { categoryId, productId } = useParams();
  // ...
}
```

You should ensure that all dynamic segments in a given path are unique. Otherwise, as the `params` object is populated - latter dynamic segment values will override earlier values.

## Optional Segments

You can make a route segment optional by adding a `?` to the end of the segment.

```tsx
<Route path=":lang?/categories" element={<Categories />} />
```

You can have optional static segments, too:

```tsx
<Route path="users/:userId/edit?" element={<User />} />
```

## Splats

Also known as "catchall" and "star" segments. If a route path pattern ends with `/*` then it will match any characters following the `/`, including other `/` characters.

```tsx
<Route path="files/*" element={<File />} />
```

```tsx
let params = useParams();
// params["*"] will contain the remaining URL after files/
let filePath = params["*"];
```

You can destructure the `*`, you just have to assign it a new name. A common name is `splat`:

```tsx
let { "*": splat } = useParams();
```

## Linking

Link to routes from your UI with `Link` and `NavLink`

```tsx
import { NavLink, Link } from "react-router";

function Header() {
  return (
    <nav>
      {/* NavLink makes it easy to show active states */}
      <NavLink
        to="/"
        className={({ isActive }) =>
          isActive ? "active" : ""
        }
      >
        Home
      </NavLink>

      <Link to="/concerts/salt-lake-city">Concerts</Link>
    </nav>
  );
}
```
---
title: URL Values
---

# URL Values

[MODES: declarative]

## Route Params

Route params are the parsed values from a dynamic segment.

```tsx
<Route path="/concerts/:city" element={<City />} />
```

In this case, `:city` is the dynamic segment. The parsed value for that city will be available from `useParams`

```tsx
import { useParams } from "react-router";

function City() {
  let { city } = useParams();
  let data = useFakeDataLibrary(`/api/v2/cities/${city}`);
  // ...
}
```

## URL Search Params

Search params are the values after a `?` in the URL. They are accessible from `useSearchParams`, which returns an instance of [`URLSearchParams`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams)

```tsx
function SearchResults() {
  let [searchParams] = useSearchParams();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        You searched for <i>{searchParams.get("q")}</i>
      </p>
      <FakeSearchResults />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Location Object

React Router creates a custom `location` object with some useful information on it accessible with `useLocation`.

```tsx
function useAnalytics() {
  let location = useLocation();
  useEffect(() => {
    sendFakeAnalytics(location.pathname);
  }, [location]);
}

function useScrollRestoration() {
  let location = useLocation();
  useEffect(() => {
    fakeRestoreScroll(location.key);
  }, [location]);
}
```

# Navigating

[MODES: declarative]

## Introduction

Users navigate your application with `<Link>`, `<NavLink>`, and `useNavigate`.

## NavLink

This component is for navigation links that need to render an active state.

```tsx
import { NavLink } from "react-router";

export function MyAppNav() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <NavLink to="/" end>
        Home
      </NavLink>
      <NavLink to="/trending" end>
        Trending Concerts
      </NavLink>
      <NavLink to="/concerts">All Concerts</NavLink>
      <NavLink to="/account">Account</NavLink>
    </nav>
  );
}
```

Whenever a `NavLink` is active, it will automatically have an `.active` class name for easy styling with CSS:

```css
a.active {
  color: red;
}
```

It also has callback props on `className`, `style`, and `children` with the active state for inline styling or conditional rendering:

```tsx
// className
<NavLink
  to="/messages"
  className={({ isActive }) =>
    isActive ? "text-red-500" : "text-black"
  }
>
  Messages
</NavLink>
```

```tsx
// style
<NavLink
  to="/messages"
  style={({ isActive }) => ({
    color: isActive ? "red" : "black",
  })}
>
  Messages
</NavLink>
```

```tsx
// children
<NavLink to="/message">
  {({ isActive }) => (
    <span className={isActive ? "active" : ""}>
      {isActive ? "👉" : ""} Tasks
    </span>
  )}
</NavLink>
```

## Link

Use `<Link>` when the link doesn't need active styling:

```tsx
import { Link } from "react-router";

export function LoggedOutMessage() {
  return (
    <p>
      You've been logged out.{" "}
      <Link to="/login">Login again</Link>
    </p>
  );
}
```

## useNavigate

This hook allows the programmer to navigate the user to a new page without the user interacting.

For normal navigation, it's best to use `Link` or `NavLink`. They provide a better default user experience like keyboard events, accessibility labeling, "open in new window", right click context menus, etc.

Reserve usage of `useNavigate` to situations where the user is _not_ interacting but you need to navigate, for example:

- After a form submission completes
- Logging them out after inactivity
- Timed UIs like quizzes, etc.

```tsx
import { useNavigate } from "react-router";

export function LoginPage() {
  let navigate = useNavigate();

  return (
    <>
      <MyHeader />
      <MyLoginForm
        onSuccess={() => {
          navigate("/dashboard");
        }}
      />
      <MyFooter />
    </>
  );
}
```

# Installation

[MODES: declarative]

## Introduction

You can start with a React template from Vite and choose "React", otherwise bootstrap your application however you prefer.

```shellscript nonumber
npx create-vite@latest
```

Next install React Router from npm:

```shellscript nonumber
npm i react-router
```

Finally, render a `<BrowserRouter>` around your application:

```tsx lines=[3,9-11]
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router";
import App from "./app";

const root = document.getElementById("root");

ReactDOM.createRoot(root).render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>
);
```

# Picking a Mode

React Router is a multi-strategy router for React. There are three primary ways, or "modes", to use it in your app. Across the docs you'll see these icons indicating which mode the content is relevant to:

[MODES: framework, data, declarative]

<p></p>

The features available in each mode are additive, so moving from Declarative to Data to Framework simply adds more features at the cost of architectural control. So pick your mode based on how much control or how much help you want from React Router.

The mode depends on which "top level" router API you're using:

**Declarative**

Declarative mode enables basic routing features like matching URLs to components, navigating around the app, and providing active states with APIs like `<Link>`, `useNavigate`, and `useLocation`.

```tsx
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router";

ReactDOM.createRoot(root).render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>
);
```

**Data**

By moving route configuration outside of React rendering, Data Mode adds data loading, actions, pending states and more with APIs like `loader`, `action`, and `useFetcher`.

```tsx
import {
  createBrowserRouter,
  RouterProvider,
} from "react-router";

let router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    Component: Root,
    loader: loadRootData,
  },
]);

ReactDOM.createRoot(root).render(
  <RouterProvider router={router} />
);
```

**Framework**

Framework Mode wraps Data Mode with a Vite plugin to add the full React Router experience with:

- typesafe `href`
- typesafe Route Module API
- intelligent code splitting
- SPA, SSR, and static rendering strategies
- and more

```ts filename=routes.ts
import { index, route } from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
  index("./home.tsx"),
  route("products/:pid", "./product.tsx"),
];
```

You'll then have access to the Route Module API with typesafe params, loaderData, code splitting, SPA/SSR/SSG strategies, and more.

```ts filename=product.tsx
import { Route } from "+./types/product.tsx";

export async function loader({ params }: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  let product = await getProduct(params.pid);
  return { product };
}

export default function Product({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  return <div>{loaderData.product.name}</div>;
}
```

## Decision Advice

Every mode supports any architecture and deployment target, so the question isn't really about if you want SSR, SPA, etc. It's about how much you want to do yourself.

**Use Framework Mode if you:**

- are too new to have an opinion
- are considering Next.js, Solid Start, SvelteKit, Astro, TanStack Start, etc. and want to compare
- just want to build something with React
- might want to server render, might not
- are coming from Remix (React Router v7 is the "next version" after Remix v2)
- are migrating from Next.js

[→ Get Started with Framework Mode](./framework/installation).

**Use Data Mode if you:**

- want data features but also want to have control over bundling, data, and server abstractions
- started a data router in v6.4 and are happy with it

[→ Get Started with Data Mode](./data/custom).

**Use Declarative Mode if you:**

- want to use React Router as simply as possible
- are coming from v6 and are happy with the `<BrowserRouter>`
- have a data layer that either skips pending states (like local first, background data replication/sync) or has its own abstractions for them
- are coming from Create React App (you may want to consider framework mode though)

[→ Get Started with Declarative Mode](./library/installation).

# Routing

[MODES: data]

## Configuring Routes

Routes are configured as the first argument to `createBrowserRouter`. At a minimum, you need a path and component:

```tsx
import { createBrowserRouter } from "react-router";

function Root() {
  return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
}

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  { path: "/", Component: Root },
]);
```

Here is a larger sample route config:

```ts filename=app/routes.ts
createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    Component: Root,
    children: [
      { index: true, Component: Home },
      { path: "about", Component: About },
      {
        path: "auth",
        Component: AuthLayout,
        children: [
          { path: "login", Component: Login },
          { path: "register", Component: Register },
        ],
      },
      {
        path: "concerts",
        children: [
          { index: true, Component: ConcertsHome },
          { path: ":city", Component: ConcertsCity },
          { path: "trending", Component: ConcertsTrending },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
]);
```

## Route Objects

Route objects define the behavior of a route beyond just the path and component, like data loading and actions. We'll go into more detail in the [Route Object guide](./route-objects), but here's a quick example of a loader.

```tsx filename=app/team.tsx
import {
  createBrowserRouter,
  useLoaderData,
} from "react-router";

createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/teams/:teamId",
    loader: async ({ params }) => {
      let team = await fetchTeam(params.teamId);
      return { name: team.name };
    },
    Component: Team,
  },
]);

function Team() {
  let data = useLoaderData();
  return <h1>{data.name}</h1>;
}
```

## Nested Routes

Routes can be nested inside parent routes through `children`.

```ts filename=app/routes.ts
createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/dashboard",
    Component: Dashboard,
    children: [
      { index: true, Component: Home },
      { path: "settings", Component: Settings },
    ],
  },
]);
```

The path of the parent is automatically included in the child, so this config creates both `"/dashboard"` and `"/dashboard/settings"` URLs.

Child routes are rendered through the `<Outlet/>` in the parent route.

```tsx filename=app/dashboard.tsx
import { Outlet } from "react-router";

export default function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      {/* will either be <Home> or <Settings> */}
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Layout Routes

Omitting the `path` in a route creates new [Nested Routes](#nested-routes) for its children without adding any segments to the URL.

```tsx lines=[3,16]
createBrowserRouter([
  {
    // no path on this parent route, just the component
    Component: MarketingLayout,
    children: [
      { index: true, Component: Home },
      { path: "contact", Component: Contact },
    ],
  },

  {
    path: "projects",
    children: [
      { index: true, Component: ProjectsHome },
      {
        // again, no path, just a component for the layout
        Component: ProjectLayout,
        children: [
          { path: ":pid", Component: Project },
          { path: ":pid/edit", Component: EditProject },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
]);
```

Note that:

- `Home` and `Contact` will be rendered into the `MarketingLayout` outlet
- `Project` and `EditProject` will be rendered into the `ProjectLayout` outlet while `ProjectsHome` will not.

## Index Routes

Index routes are defined by setting `index: true` on a route object without a path.

```ts
{ index: true, Component: Home }
```

Index routes render into their parent's [Outlet][outlet] at their parent's URL (like a default child route).

```ts lines=[4,5,10,11]
import { createBrowserRouter } from "react-router";

createBrowserRouter([
  // renders at "/"
  { index: true, Component: Home },
  {
    Component: Dashboard,
    path: "/dashboard",
    children: [
      // renders at "/dashboard"
      { index: true, Component: DashboardHome },
      { path: "settings", Component: DashboardSettings },
    ],
  },
]);
```

Note that index routes can't have children.

## Prefix Route

A route with just a path and no component creates a group of routes with a path prefix.

```tsx lines=[3]
createBrowserRouter([
  {
    // no component, just a path
    path: "/projects",
    children: [
      { index: true, Component: ProjectsHome },
      { path: ":pid", Component: Project },
      { path: ":pid/edit", Component: EditProject },
    ],
  },
]);
```

This creates the routes `/projects`, `/projects/:pid`, and `/projects/:pid/edit` without introducing a layout component.

## Dynamic Segments

If a path segment starts with `:` then it becomes a "dynamic segment". When the route matches the URL, the dynamic segment will be parsed from the URL and provided as `params` to other router APIs.

```ts lines=[2]
{
  path: "teams/:teamId",
  loader: async ({ params }) => {
    // params are available in loaders/actions
    let team = await fetchTeam(params.teamId);
    return { name: team.name };
  },
  Component: Team,
}
```

```tsx
import { useParams } from "react-router";

function Team() {
  // params are available in components through useParams
  let params = useParams();
  // ...
}
```

You can have multiple dynamic segments in one route path:

```ts
{
  path: "c/:categoryId/p/:productId";
}
```

## Optional Segments

You can make a route segment optional by adding a `?` to the end of the segment.

```ts
{
  path: ":lang?/categories";
}
```

You can have optional static segments, too:

```ts
{
  path: "users/:userId/edit?";
}
```

## Splats

Also known as "catchall" and "star" segments. If a route path pattern ends with `/*` then it will match any characters following the `/`, including other `/` characters.

```ts
{
  path: "files/*";
  loader: async ({ params }) => {
    params["*"]; // will contain the remaining URL after files/
  };
}
```

You can destructure the `*`, you just have to assign it a new name. A common name is `splat`:

```tsx
const { "*": splat } = params;
```

# Data Loading

[MODES: data]

## Providing Data

Data is provided to route components from route loaders:

```tsx
createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    loader: () => {
      // return data from here
      return { records: await getSomeRecords() };
    },
    Component: MyRoute,
  },
]);
```

## Accessing Data

The data is available in route components with `useLoaderData`.

```tsx
import { useLoaderData } from "react-router";

function MyRoute() {
  const { records } = useLoaderData();
  return <div>{records.length}</div>;
}
```

As the user navigates between routes, the loaders are called before the route component is rendered.

# Custom Framework

[MODES: data]

## Introduction

Instead of using `@react-router/dev`, you can integrate React Router's framework features (like loaders, actions, fetchers, etc.) into your own bundler and server abstractions with Data Mode..

## Client Rendering

### 1. Create a Router

The browser runtime API that enables route module APIs (loaders, actions, etc.) is `createBrowserRouter`.

It takes an array of route objects that support loaders, actions, error boundaries and more. The React Router Vite plugin creates one of these from `routes.ts`, but you can create one manually (or with an abstraction) and use your own bundler.

```tsx
import { createBrowserRouter } from "react-router";

let router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    Component: Root,
    children: [
      {
        path: "shows/:showId",
        Component: Show,
        loader: ({ request, params }) =>
          fetch(`/api/show/${params.id}.json`, {
            signal: request.signal,
          }),
      },
    ],
  },
]);
```

### 2. Render the Router

To render the router in the browser, use `<RouterProvider>`.

```tsx
import {
  createBrowserRouter,
  RouterProvider,
} from "react-router";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <RouterProvider router={router} />
);
```

### 3. Lazy Loading

Routes can take most of their definition lazily with the `lazy` property.

```tsx
createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/show/:showId",
    lazy: () => {
      let [loader, action, Component] = await Promise.all([
        import("./show.loader.js"),
        import("./show.action.js"),
        import("./show.component.js"),
      ]);
      return { loader, action, Component };
    },
  },
]);
```

## Server Rendering

To server render a custom setup, there are a few server APIs available for rendering and data loading.

This guide simply gives you some ideas about how it works. For deeper understanding, please see the [Custom Framework Example Repo](https://github.com/remix-run/custom-react-router-framework-example)

### 1. Define Your Routes

Routes are the same kinds of objects on the server as the client.

```tsx
export default [
  {
    path: "/",
    Component: Root,
    children: [
      {
        path: "shows/:showId",
        Component: Show,
        loader: ({ params }) => {
          return db.loadShow(params.id);
        },
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

### 2. Create a static handler

Turn your routes into a request handler with `createStaticHandler`:

```tsx
import { createStaticHandler } from "react-router";
import routes from "./some-routes";

let { query, dataRoutes } = createStaticHandler(routes);
```

### 3. Get Routing Context and Render

React Router works with web fetch [Requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request), so if your server doesn't, you'll need to adapt whatever objects it uses to a web fetch `Request` object.

This step assumes your server receives `Request` objects.

```tsx
import { renderToString } from "react-dom/server";
import {
  createStaticHandler,
  createStaticRouter,
  StaticRouterProvider,
} from "react-router";

import routes from "./some-routes.js";

let { query, dataRoutes } = createStaticHandler(routes);

export async function handler(request: Request) {
  // 1. run actions/loaders to get the routing context with `query`
  let context = await query(request);

  // If `query` returns a Response, send it raw (a route probably a redirected)
  if (context instanceof Response) {
    return context;
  }

  // 2. Create a static router for SSR
  let router = createStaticRouter(dataRoutes, context);

  // 3. Render everything with StaticRouterProvider
  let html = renderToString(
    <StaticRouterProvider
      router={router}
      context={context}
    />
  );

  // Setup headers from action and loaders from deepest match
  let leaf = context.matches[context.matches.length - 1];
  let actionHeaders = context.actionHeaders[leaf.route.id];
  let loaderHeaders = context.loaderHeaders[leaf.route.id];
  let headers = new Headers(actionHeaders);
  if (loaderHeaders) {
    for (let [key, value] of loaderHeaders.entries()) {
      headers.append(key, value);
    }
  }

  headers.set("Content-Type", "text/html; charset=utf-8");

  // 4. send a response
  return new Response(`<!DOCTYPE html>${html}`, {
    status: context.statusCode,
    headers,
  });
}
```

### 4. Hydrate in the browser

Hydration data is embedded onto `window.__staticRouterHydrationData`, use that to initialize your client side router and render a `<RouterProvider>`.

```tsx
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { hydrateRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { RouterProvider } from "react-router/dom";
import routes from "./app/routes.js";
import { createBrowserRouter } from "react-router";

let router = createBrowserRouter(routes, {
  hydrationData: window.__staticRouterHydrationData,
});

hydrateRoot(
  document,
  <StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </StrictMode>
);
```

# Route Object

[MODES: data]

## Introduction

The objects passed to `createBrowserRouter` are called Route Objects.

```tsx lines=[2-5]
createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    Component: App,
  },
]);
```

Route modules are the foundation of React Router's data features, they define:

- data loading
- actions
- revalidation
- error boundaries
- and more

This guide is a quick overview of every route object feature.

## Component

The `Component` property in a route object defines the component that will render when the route matches.

```tsx lines=[4]
createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    Component: MyRouteComponent,
  },
]);

function MyRouteComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Look ma!</h1>
      <p>
        I'm still using React Router after like 10 years.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## `loader`

Route loaders provide data to route components before they are rendered.

```tsx
import {
  useLoaderData,
  createBrowserRouter,
} from "react-router";

createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    loader: loader,
    Component: MyRoute,
  },
]);

async function loader({ params }) {
  return { message: "Hello, world!" };
}

function MyRoute() {
  let data = useLoaderData();
  return <h1>{data.message}</h1>;
}
```

See also:

- [`loader` params][loader-params]

## `action`

Route actions allow server-side data mutations with automatic revalidation of all loader data on the page when called from `<Form>`, `useFetcher`, and `useSubmit`.

```tsx
import {
  createBrowserRouter,
  useLoaderData,
  useActionData,
  Form,
} from "react-router";
import { TodoList } from "~/components/TodoList";

createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/items",
    action: action,
    loader: loader,
    Component: Items,
  },
]);

async function action({ request }) {
  const data = await request.formData();
  const todo = await fakeDb.addItem({
    title: data.get("title"),
  });
  return { ok: true };
}

// this data will be revalidated after the action completes...
async function loader() {
  const items = await fakeDb.getItems();
  return { items };
}

// ...so that the list here is updated automatically
export default function Items() {
  let data = useLoaderData();
  return (
    <div>
      <List items={data.items} />
      <Form method="post" navigate={false}>
        <input type="text" name="title" />
        <button type="submit">Create Todo</button>
      </Form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## `shouldRevalidate`

By default, all routes are revalidated after actions. This function allows a route to opt-out of revalidation for actions that don't affect its data.

```tsx
import type { ShouldRevalidateFunctionArgs } from "react-router";

function shouldRevalidate(
  arg: ShouldRevalidateFunctionArgs
) {
  return true; // false
}

createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    shouldRevalidate: shouldRevalidate,
    Component: MyRoute,
  },
]);
```

## `lazy`

Most properties can be lazily imported to reduce the initial bundle size.

```tsx
createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/app",
    lazy: async () => {
      // load component and loader in parallel before rendering
      const [Component, loader] = await Promise.all([
        import("./app"),
        import("./app-loader"),
      ]);
      return { Component, loader };
    },
  },
]);
```

Data mutations are done through Route actions defined on the `action` property of a route object. When the action completes, all loader data on the page is revalidated to keep your UI in sync with the data without writing any code to do it.

```tsx
import { createBrowserRouter } from "react-router";
import { someApi } from "./api";

let router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/projects/:projectId",
    Component: Project,
    action: async ({ request }) => {
      let formData = await request.formData();
      let title = formData.get("title");
      let project = await someApi.updateProject({ title });
      return project;
    },
  },
]);
```

## Calling Actions

Actions are called declaratively through `<Form>` and imperatively through `useSubmit` (or `<fetcher.Form>` and `fetcher.submit`) by referencing the route's path and a "post" method.

### Calling actions with a Form

```tsx
import { Form } from "react-router";

function SomeComponent() {
  return (
    <Form action="/projects/123" method="post">
      <input type="text" name="title" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

This will cause a navigation and a new entry will be added to the browser history.

### Calling actions with useSubmit

You can submit form data to an action imperatively with `useSubmit`.

```tsx
import { useCallback } from "react";
import { useSubmit } from "react-router";
import { useFakeTimer } from "fake-lib";

function useQuizTimer() {
  let submit = useSubmit();

  let cb = useCallback(() => {
    submit(
      { quizTimedOut: true },
      { action: "/end-quiz", method: "post" }
    );
  }, []);

  let tenMinutes = 10 * 60 * 1000;
  useFakeTimer(tenMinutes, cb);
}
```

This will cause a navigation and a new entry will be added to the browser history.

### Calling actions with a fetcher

Fetchers allow you to submit data to actions (and loaders) without causing a navigation (no new entries in the browser history).

```tsx
import { useFetcher } from "react-router";

function Task() {
  let fetcher = useFetcher();
  let busy = fetcher.state !== "idle";

  return (
    <fetcher.Form method="post" action="/update-task/123">
      <input type="text" name="title" />
      <button type="submit">
        {busy ? "Saving..." : "Save"}
      </button>
    </fetcher.Form>
  );
}
```

They also have the imperative `submit` method.

```tsx
fetcher.submit(
  { title: "New Title" },
  { action: "/update-task/123", method: "post" }
);
```

See the [Using Fetchers][fetchers] guide for more information.

## Accessing Action Data

Actions can return data available through `useActionData` in the route component or `fetcher.data` when using a fetcher.

```tsx
function Project() {
  let actionData = useActionData();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Project</h1>
      <Form method="post">
        <input type="text" name="title" />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </Form>
      {actionData ? (
        <p>{actionData.title} updated</p>
      ) : null}
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Installation

[MODES: data]

## Bootstrap with a Bundler Template

You can start with a React template from Vite and choose "React", otherwise bootstrap your application however you prefer (Parcel, Webpack, etc).

```shellscript nonumber
npx create-vite@latest
```

## Install React Router

Next install React Router from npm:

```shellscript nonumber
npm i react-router
```

## Create a Router and Render

Create a router and pass it to `RouterProvider`:

```tsx lines=[1-4,9-14,19]
import {
  createBrowserRouter,
  RouterProvider,
} from "react-router";

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <div>Hello World</div>,
  },
]);

const root = document.getElementById("root");

ReactDOM.createRoot(root).render(
  <RouterProvider router={router} />
);
```

Next: [Routing](./routing)

title: File Route Conventions

# File Route Conventions

The `@react-router/fs-routes` package enables file-convention based route config.

## Setting up

First install the `@react-router/fs-routes` package:

```shellscript nonumber
npm i @react-router/fs-routes
```

Then use it to provide route config in your `app/routes.ts` file:

```tsx filename=app/routes.ts
import { type RouteConfig } from "@react-router/dev/routes";
import { flatRoutes } from "@react-router/fs-routes";

export default flatRoutes() satisfies RouteConfig;
```

Any modules in the `app/routes` directory will become routes in your application by default.
The `ignoredRouteFiles` option allows you to specify files that should not be included as routes:

```tsx filename=app/routes.ts
import { type RouteConfig } from "@react-router/dev/routes";
import { flatRoutes } from "@react-router/fs-routes";

export default flatRoutes({
  ignoredRouteFiles: ["home.tsx"],
}) satisfies RouteConfig;
```

This will look for routes in the `app/routes` directory by default, but this can be configured via the `rootDirectory` option which is relative to your app directory:

```tsx filename=app/routes.ts
import { type RouteConfig } from "@react-router/dev/routes";
import { flatRoutes } from "@react-router/fs-routes";

export default flatRoutes({
  rootDirectory: "file-routes",
}) satisfies RouteConfig;
```

The rest of this guide will assume you're using the default `app/routes` directory.

## Basic Routes

The filename maps to the route's URL pathname, except for `_index.tsx` which is the [index route][index_route] for the [root route][root_route]. You can use `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts` or `.tsx` file extensions.

```text lines=[3-4]
app/
├── routes/
│   ├── _index.tsx
│   └── about.tsx
└── root.tsx
```

| URL      | Matched Routes          |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| `/`      | `app/routes/_index.tsx` |
| `/about` | `app/routes/about.tsx`  |

Note that these routes will be rendered in the outlet of `app/root.tsx` because of [nested routing][nested_routing].

## Dot Delimiters

Adding a `.` to a route filename will create a `/` in the URL.

```text lines=[5-7]
 app/
├── routes/
│   ├── _index.tsx
│   ├── about.tsx
│   ├── concerts.trending.tsx
│   ├── concerts.salt-lake-city.tsx
│   └── concerts.san-diego.tsx
└── root.tsx
```

| URL                        | Matched Route                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `/`                        | `app/routes/_index.tsx`                  |
| `/about`                   | `app/routes/about.tsx`                   |
| `/concerts/trending`       | `app/routes/concerts.trending.tsx`       |
| `/concerts/salt-lake-city` | `app/routes/concerts.salt-lake-city.tsx` |
| `/concerts/san-diego`      | `app/routes/concerts.san-diego.tsx`      |

The dot delimiter also creates nesting, see the [nesting section][nested_routes] for more information.

## Dynamic Segments

Usually your URLs aren't static but data-driven. Dynamic segments allow you to match segments of the URL and use that value in your code. You create them with the `$` prefix.

```text lines=[5]
 app/
├── routes/
│   ├── _index.tsx
│   ├── about.tsx
│   ├── concerts.$city.tsx
│   └── concerts.trending.tsx
└── root.tsx
```

| URL                        | Matched Route                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `/`                        | `app/routes/_index.tsx`            |
| `/about`                   | `app/routes/about.tsx`             |
| `/concerts/trending`       | `app/routes/concerts.trending.tsx` |
| `/concerts/salt-lake-city` | `app/routes/concerts.$city.tsx`    |
| `/concerts/san-diego`      | `app/routes/concerts.$city.tsx`    |

The value will be parsed from the URL and passed to various APIs. We call these values "URL Parameters". The most useful places to access the URL params are in [loaders] and [actions].

```tsx
export async function serverLoader({ params }) {
  return fakeDb.getAllConcertsForCity(params.city);
}
```

You'll note the property name on the `params` object maps directly to the name of your file: `$city.tsx` becomes `params.city`.

Routes can have multiple dynamic segments, like `concerts.$city.$date`, both are accessed on the params object by name:

```tsx
export async function serverLoader({ params }) {
  return fake.db.getConcerts({
    date: params.date,
    city: params.city,
  });
}
```

See the [routing guide][routing_guide] for more information.

## Nested Routes

Nested Routing is the general idea of coupling segments of the URL to component hierarchy and data. You can read more about it in the [Routing Guide][nested_routing].

You create nested routes with [dot delimiters][dot_delimiters]. If the filename before the `.` matches another route filename, it automatically becomes a child route to the matching parent. Consider these routes:

```text lines=[5-8]
 app/
├── routes/
│   ├── _index.tsx
│   ├── about.tsx
│   ├── concerts._index.tsx
│   ├── concerts.$city.tsx
│   ├── concerts.trending.tsx
│   └── concerts.tsx
└── root.tsx
```

All the routes that start with `app/routes/concerts.` will be child routes of `app/routes/concerts.tsx` and render inside the [parent route's outlet][nested_routing].

| URL                        | Matched Route                      | Layout                    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `/`                        | `app/routes/_index.tsx`            | `app/root.tsx`            |
| `/about`                   | `app/routes/about.tsx`             | `app/root.tsx`            |
| `/concerts`                | `app/routes/concerts._index.tsx`   | `app/routes/concerts.tsx` |
| `/concerts/trending`       | `app/routes/concerts.trending.tsx` | `app/routes/concerts.tsx` |
| `/concerts/salt-lake-city` | `app/routes/concerts.$city.tsx`    | `app/routes/concerts.tsx` |

Note you typically want to add an index route when you add nested routes so that something renders inside the parent's outlet when users visit the parent URL directly.

For example, if the URL is `/concerts/salt-lake-city` then the UI hierarchy will look like this:

```tsx
<Root>
  <Concerts>
    <City />
  </Concerts>
</Root>
```

## Nested URLs without Layout Nesting

Sometimes you want the URL to be nested, but you don't want the automatic layout nesting. You can opt out of nesting with a trailing underscore on the parent segment:

```text lines=[8]
 app/
├── routes/
│   ├── _index.tsx
│   ├── about.tsx
│   ├── concerts.$city.tsx
│   ├── concerts.trending.tsx
│   ├── concerts.tsx
│   └── concerts_.mine.tsx
└── root.tsx
```

| URL                        | Matched Route                      | Layout                    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `/`                        | `app/routes/_index.tsx`            | `app/root.tsx`            |
| `/about`                   | `app/routes/about.tsx`             | `app/root.tsx`            |
| `/concerts/mine`           | `app/routes/concerts_.mine.tsx`    | `app/root.tsx`            |
| `/concerts/trending`       | `app/routes/concerts.trending.tsx` | `app/routes/concerts.tsx` |
| `/concerts/salt-lake-city` | `app/routes/concerts.$city.tsx`    | `app/routes/concerts.tsx` |

Note that `/concerts/mine` does not nest with `app/routes/concerts.tsx` anymore, but `app/root.tsx`. The `trailing_` underscore creates a path segment, but it does not create layout nesting.

Think of the `trailing_` underscore as the long bit at the end of your parent's signature, writing you out of the will, removing the segment that follows from the layout nesting.

## Nested Layouts without Nested URLs

We call these <a name="pathless-routes"><b>Pathless Routes</b></a>

Sometimes you want to share a layout with a group of routes without adding any path segments to the URL. A common example is a set of authentication routes that have a different header/footer than the public pages or the logged in app experience. You can do this with a `_leading` underscore.

```text lines=[3-5]
 app/
├── routes/
│   ├── _auth.login.tsx
│   ├── _auth.register.tsx
│   ├── _auth.tsx
│   ├── _index.tsx
│   ├── concerts.$city.tsx
│   └── concerts.tsx
└── root.tsx
```

| URL                        | Matched Route                   | Layout                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `/`                        | `app/routes/_index.tsx`         | `app/root.tsx`            |
| `/login`                   | `app/routes/_auth.login.tsx`    | `app/routes/_auth.tsx`    |
| `/register`                | `app/routes/_auth.register.tsx` | `app/routes/_auth.tsx`    |
| `/concerts`                | `app/routes/concerts.tsx`       | `app/routes/concerts.tsx` |
| `/concerts/salt-lake-city` | `app/routes/concerts.$city.tsx` | `app/routes/concerts.tsx` |

Think of the `_leading` underscore as a blanket you're pulling over the filename, hiding the filename from the URL.

## Optional Segments

Wrapping a route segment in parentheses will make the segment optional.

```text lines=[3-5]
 app/
├── routes/
│   ├── ($lang)._index.tsx
│   ├── ($lang).$productId.tsx
│   └── ($lang).categories.tsx
└── root.tsx
```

| URL                        | Matched Route                       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `/`                        | `app/routes/($lang)._index.tsx`     |
| `/categories`              | `app/routes/($lang).categories.tsx` |
| `/en/categories`           | `app/routes/($lang).categories.tsx` |
| `/fr/categories`           | `app/routes/($lang).categories.tsx` |
| `/american-flag-speedo`    | `app/routes/($lang)._index.tsx`     |
| `/en/american-flag-speedo` | `app/routes/($lang).$productId.tsx` |
| `/fr/american-flag-speedo` | `app/routes/($lang).$productId.tsx` |

You may wonder why `/american-flag-speedo` is matching the `($lang)._index.tsx` route instead of `($lang).$productId.tsx`. This is because when you have an optional dynamic param segment followed by another dynamic param, it cannot reliably be determined if a single-segment URL such as `/american-flag-speedo` should match `/:lang` `/:productId`. Optional segments match eagerly and thus it will match `/:lang`. If you have this type of setup it's recommended to look at `params.lang` in the `($lang)._index.tsx` loader and redirect to `/:lang/american-flag-speedo` for the current/default language if `params.lang` is not a valid language code.

## Splat Routes

While [dynamic segments][dynamic_segments] match a single path segment (the stuff between two `/` in a URL), a splat route will match the rest of a URL, including the slashes.

```text lines=[4,6]
 app/
├── routes/
│   ├── _index.tsx
│   ├── $.tsx
│   ├── about.tsx
│   └── files.$.tsx
└── root.tsx
```

| URL                                          | Matched Route            |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `/`                                          | `app/routes/_index.tsx`  |
| `/about`                                     | `app/routes/about.tsx`   |
| `/beef/and/cheese`                           | `app/routes/$.tsx`       |
| `/files`                                     | `app/routes/files.$.tsx` |
| `/files/talks/react-conf_old.pdf`            | `app/routes/files.$.tsx` |
| `/files/talks/react-conf_final.pdf`          | `app/routes/files.$.tsx` |
| `/files/talks/react-conf-FINAL-MAY_2024.pdf` | `app/routes/files.$.tsx` |

Similar to dynamic route parameters, you can access the value of the matched path on the splat route's `params` with the `"*"` key.

```tsx filename=app/routes/files.$.tsx
export async function serverLoader({ params }) {
  const filePath = params["*"];
  return fake.getFileInfo(filePath);
}
```

## Escaping Special Characters

If you want one of the special characters used for these route conventions to actually be a part of the URL, you can escape the conventions with `[]` characters. This can be especially helpful for [resource routes][resource_routes] that include an extension in the URL.

| Filename                            | URL                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `app/routes/sitemap[.]xml.tsx`      | `/sitemap.xml`      |
| `app/routes/[sitemap.xml].tsx`      | `/sitemap.xml`      |
| `app/routes/weird-url.[_index].tsx` | `/weird-url/_index` |
| `app/routes/dolla-bills-[$].tsx`    | `/dolla-bills-$`    |
| `app/routes/[[so-weird]].tsx`       | `/[so-weird]`       |
| `app/routes/reports.$id[.pdf].ts`   | `/reports/123.pdf`  |

## Folders for Organization

Routes can also be folders with a `route.tsx` file inside defining the route module. The rest of the files in the folder will not become routes. This allows you to organize your code closer to the routes that use them instead of repeating the feature names across other folders.

The files inside a folder have no meaning for the route paths, the route path is completely defined by the folder name.

Consider these routes:

```text
 app/
├── routes/
│   ├── _landing._index.tsx
│   ├── _landing.about.tsx
│   ├── _landing.tsx
│   ├── app._index.tsx
│   ├── app.projects.tsx
│   ├── app.tsx
│   └── app_.projects.$id.roadmap.tsx
└── root.tsx
```

Some, or all of them can be folders holding their own `route` module inside.

```text
app/
├── routes/
│   ├── _landing._index/
│   │   ├── route.tsx
│   │   └── scroll-experience.tsx
│   ├── _landing.about/
│   │   ├── employee-profile-card.tsx
│   │   ├── get-employee-data.server.ts
│   │   ├── route.tsx
│   │   └── team-photo.jpg
│   ├── _landing/
│   │   ├── footer.tsx
│   │   ├── header.tsx
│   │   └── route.tsx
│   ├── app._index/
│   │   ├── route.tsx
│   │   └── stats.tsx
│   ├── app.projects/
│   │   ├── get-projects.server.ts
│   │   ├── project-buttons.tsx
│   │   ├── project-card.tsx
│   │   └── route.tsx
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── footer.tsx
│   │   ├── primary-nav.tsx
│   │   └── route.tsx
│   ├── app_.projects.$id.roadmap/
│   │   ├── chart.tsx
│   │   ├── route.tsx
│   │   └── update-timeline.server.ts
│   └── contact-us.tsx
└── root.tsx
```

Note that when you turn a route module into a folder, the route module becomes `folder/route.tsx`, all other modules in the folder will not become routes. For example:

```
# these are the same route:
app/routes/app.tsx
app/routes/app/route.tsx

# as are these
app/routes/app._index.tsx
app/routes/app._index/route.tsx
```

# Error Reporting

React Router catches errors in your route modules and sends them to [error boundaries](./error-boundary) to prevent blank pages when errors occur. However, ErrorBoundary isn't sufficient for logging and reporting errors. To access these caught errors, use the handleError export of the server entry module.

## 1. Reveal the server entry

If you don't see `entry.server.tsx` in your app directory, you're using a default entry. Reveal it with this cli command:

```shellscript nonumber
react-router reveal
```

## 2. Export your error handler

This function is called whenever React Router catches an error in your application on the server.

```tsx filename=entry.server.tsx
import { type HandleErrorFunction } from "react-router";

export const handleError: HandleErrorFunction = (
  error,
  { request }
) => {
  // React Router may abort some interrupted requests, don't log those
  if (!request.signal.aborted) {
    myReportError(error);

    // make sure to still log the error so you can see it
    console.error(error);
  }
};
```

title: Meta Tags and SEO
hidden: true

[copy pasted from route module doc]

By default, meta descriptors will render a [`<meta>` tag][meta-element] in most cases. The two exceptions are:

- `{ title }` renders a `<title>` tag
- `{ "script:ld+json" }` renders a `<script type="application/ld+json">` tag, and its value should be a serializable object that is stringified and injected into the tag.

```tsx
export function meta() {
  return [
    {
      "script:ld+json": {
        "@context": "https://schema.org",
        "@type": "Organization",
        name: "React Router",
        url: "https://reactrouter.com",
      },
    },
  ];
}
```

A meta descriptor can also render a [`<link>` tag][link-element] by setting the `tagName` property to `"link"`. This is useful for `<link>` tags associated with SEO like `canonical` URLs. For asset links like stylesheets and favicons, you should use the [`links` export][links] instead.

```tsx
export function meta() {
  return [
    {
      tagName: "link",
      rel: "canonical",
      href: "https://reactrouter.com",
    },
  ];
}
```

title: Resource Routes

# Resource Routes

When server rendering, routes can serve "resources" instead of rendering components, like images, PDFs, JSON payloads, webhooks, etc.

## Defining a Resource Route

A route becomes a resource route by convention when its module exports a loader or action but does not export a default component.

Consider a route that serves a PDF instead of UI:

```ts
route("/reports/pdf/:id", "pdf-report.ts");
```

```tsx filename=pdf-report.ts
import type { Route } from "./+types/pdf-report";

export async function loader({ params }: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const report = await getReport(params.id);
  const pdf = await generateReportPDF(report);
  return new Response(pdf, {
    status: 200,
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/pdf",
    },
  });
}
```

Note there is no default export. That makes this route a resource route.

## Linking to Resource Routes

When linking to resource routes, use `<a>` or `<Link reloadDocument>`, otherwise React Router will attempt to use client side routing and fetching the payload (you'll get a helpful error message if you make this mistake).

```tsx
<Link reloadDocument to="/reports/pdf/123">
  View as PDF
</Link>
```

## Handling different request methods

GET requests are handled by the `loader`, while POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE are handled by the `action`:

```tsx
import type { Route } from "./+types/resource";

export function loader(_: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  return Response.json({ message: "I handle GET" });
}

export function action(_: Route.ActionArgs) {
  return Response.json({
    message: "I handle everything else",
  });
}
```

title: Status Codes

# Status Codes

Set status codes from loaders and actions with `data`.

```tsx filename=app/project.tsx lines=[3,12-15,20,23]
// route('/projects/:projectId', './project.tsx')
import type { Route } from "./+types/project";
import { data } from "react-router";
import { fakeDb } from "../db";

export async function action({
  request,
}: Route.ActionArgs) {
  let formData = await request.formData();
  let title = formData.get("title");
  if (!title) {
    return data(
      { message: "Invalid title" },
      { status: 400 }
    );
  }

  if (!projectExists(title)) {
    let project = await fakeDb.createProject({ title });
    return data(project, { status: 201 });
  } else {
    let project = await fakeDb.updateProject({ title });
    // the default status code is 200, no need for `data`
    return project;
  }
}
```

See [Form Validation](./form-validation) for more information on rendering form errors like this.

Another common status code is 404:

```tsx
// route('/projects/:projectId', './project.tsx')
import type { Route } from "./+types/project";
import { data } from "react-router";
import { fakeDb } from "../db";

export async function loader({ params }: Route.ActionArgs) {
  let project = await fakeDb.getProject(params.id);
  if (!project) {
    // throw to ErrorBoundary
    throw data(null, { status: 404 });
  }
  return project;
}
```

See the [Error Boundaries](./error-boundary) for more information on thrown `data`.

title: Pre-Rendering
---

# Pre-Rendering

Pre-Rendering allows you to speed up page loads for static content by rendering pages at build time instead of at runtime. Pre-rendering is enabled via the `prerender` config in `react-router.config.ts` and can be used in two ways based on the `ssr` config value:

- Alongside a runtime SSR server with `ssr:true` (the default value)
- Deployed to a static file server with `ssr:false`

## Pre-rendering with `ssr:true`

### Configuration

Add the `prerender` option to your config, there are three signatures:

```ts filename=react-router.config.ts lines=[7-8,10-11,13-21]
import type { Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";

export default {
  // Can be omitted - defaults to true
  ssr: true,

  // all static paths (no dynamic segments like "/post/:slug")
  prerender: true,

  // specific paths
  prerender: ["/", "/blog", "/blog/popular-post"],

  // async function for dependencies like a CMS
  async prerender({ getStaticPaths }) {
    let posts = await fakeGetPostsFromCMS();
    return [
      "/",
      "/blog",
      ...posts.map((post) => post.href),
    ];
  },
} satisfies Config;
```

### Data Loading and Pre-rendering

There is no extra application API for pre-rendering. Routes being pre-rendered use the same route `loader` functions as server rendering:

```tsx
export async function loader({ request, params }) {
  let post = await getPost(params.slug);
  return post;
}

export function Post({ loaderData }) {
  return <div>{loaderData.title}</div>;
}
```

Instead of a request coming to your route on a deployed server, the build creates a `new Request()` and runs it through your app just like a server would.

When server rendering, requests to paths that have not been pre-rendered will be server rendered as usual.

### Static File Output

The rendered result will be written out to your `build/client` directory. You'll notice two files for each path:

- `[url].html` HTML file for initial document requests
- `[url].data` file for client side navigation browser requests

The output of your build will indicate what files were pre-rendered:

```sh
> react-router build
vite v5.2.11 building for production...
...
vite v5.2.11 building SSR bundle for production...
...
Prerender: Generated build/client/index.html
Prerender: Generated build/client/blog.data
Prerender: Generated build/client/blog/index.html
Prerender: Generated build/client/blog/my-first-post.data
Prerender: Generated build/client/blog/my-first-post/index.html
...
```

During development, pre-rendering doesn't save the rendered results to the public directory, this only happens for `react-router build`.

## Pre-rendering with `ssr:false`

The above examples assume you are deploying a runtime server but are pre-rendering some static pages to avoid hitting the server, resulting in faster loads.

To disable runtime SSR and configure pre-rendering to be served from a static file server, you can set the `ssr:false` config flag:

```ts filename=react-router.config.ts
import type { Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";

export default {
  ssr: false, // disable runtime server rendering
  prerender: true, // pre-render all static routes
} satisfies Config;
```

If you specify `ssr:false` without a `prerender` config, React Router refers to that as [SPA Mode](./spa). In SPA Mode, we render a single HTML file that is capable of hydrating for _any_ of your application paths. It can do this because it only renders the `root` route into the HTML file and then determines which child routes to load based on the browser URL during hydration. This means you can use a `loader` on the root route, but not on any other routes because we don't know which routes to load until hydration in the browser.

If you want to pre-render paths with `ssr:false`, those matched routes _can_ have loaders because we'll pre-render all of the matched routes for those paths, not just the root. You cannot include `actions` or `headers` functions in any routes when `ssr:false` is set because there will be no runtime server to run them on.

### Pre-rendering with a SPA Fallback

If you want `ssr:false` but don't want to pre-render _all_ of your routes - that's fine too! You may have some paths where you need the performance/SEO benefits of pre-rendering, but other pages where a SPA would be fine.

You can do this using the combination of config options as well - just limit your `prerender` config to the paths that you want to pre-render and React Router will also output a "SPA Fallback" HTML file that can be served to hydrate any other paths (using the same approach as [SPA Mode](./spa)).

This will be written to one of the following paths:

- `build/client/index.html` - If the `/` path is not pre-rendered
- `build/client/__spa-fallback.html` - If the `/` path is pre-rendered

```ts filename=react-router.config.ts
import type { Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";

export default {
  ssr: false,

  // SPA fallback will be written to build/client/index.html
  prerender: ["/about-us"],

  // SPA fallback will be written to build/client/__spa-fallback.html
  prerender: ["/", "/about-us"],
} satisfies Config;
```

You can configure your deployment server to serve this file for any path that otherwise would 404. Some hosts do this by default, but others don't. As an example, a host may support a `_redirects` file to do this:

```
# If you did not pre-render the `/` route
/*    /index.html   200

# If you pre-rendered the `/` route
/*    /__spa-fallback.html   200
```

If you're getting 404s at valid routes for your app, it's likely you need to configure your host.

Here's another example of how you can do this with the [`sirv-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sirv-cli#user-content-single-page-applications) tool:

```sh
# If you did not pre-render the `/` route
sirv-cli build/client --single index.html

# If you pre-rendered the `/` route
sirv-cli build/client --single __spa-fallback.html
```

### Invalid Exports

When pre-rendering with `ssr:false`, React Router will error at build time if you have invalid exports to help prevent some mistakes that can be easily overlooked.

- `headers`/`action` functions are prohibited in all routes because there will be no runtime server on which to run them
- When using `ssr:false` without a `prerender` config (SPA Mode), a `loader` is permitted on the root route only
- When using `ssr:false` with a `prerender` config, a `loader` is permitted on any route matched by a `prerender` path
  - If you are using a `loader` on a pre-rendered route that has child routes, you will need to make sure the parent `loaderData` can be determined at run-time properly by either:
    - Pre-rendering all child routes so that the parent `loader` can be called at build-time for each child route path and rendered into a `.data` file, or
    - Use a `clientLoader` on the parent that can be called at run-time for non-pre-rendered child paths
---
title: HTTP Headers
---

# HTTP Headers

Headers are primarily defined with the route module `headers` export. You can also set headers in `entry.server.tsx`.

## From Route Modules

```tsx filename=some-route.tsx
import { Route } from "./+types/some-route";

export function headers(_: Route.HeadersArgs) {
  return {
    "Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'",
    "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
    "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
    "Cache-Control": "max-age=3600, s-maxage=86400",
  };
}
```

You can return either a [`Headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers) instance or `HeadersInit`.

## From loaders and actions

When the header is dependent on loader data, loaders and actions can also set headers.

### 1. Wrap your return value in `data`

```tsx lines=[1,8]
import { data } from "react-router";

export async function loader({ params }: LoaderArgs) {
  let [page, ms] = await fakeTimeCall(
    await getPage(params.id)
  );

  return data(page, {
    headers: {
      "Server-Timing": `page;dur=${ms};desc="Page query"`,
    },
  });
}
```

### 2. Return from `headers` export

Headers from loaders and actions are not sent automatically. You must explicitly return them from the `headers` export.

```tsx
export function headers({
  actionHeaders,
  loaderHeaders,
}: HeadersArgs) {
  return actionHeaders ? actionHeaders : loaderHeaders;
}
```

One notable exception is `Set-Cookie` headers, which are automatically preserved from `headers`, `loader`, and `action` in parent routes, even without exporting `headers` from the child route.

## Merging with parent headers

Consider these nested routes

```ts filename=routes.ts
route("pages", "pages-layout-with-nav.tsx", [
  route(":slug", "page.tsx"),
]);
```

If both route modules want to set headers, the headers from the deepest matching route will be sent.

When you need to keep both the parent and the child headers, you need to merge them in the child route.

### Appending

The easiest way is to simply append to the parent headers. This avoids overwriting a header the parent may have set and both are important.

```tsx
export function headers({ parentHeaders }: HeadersArgs) {
  parentHeaders.append(
    "Permissions-Policy: geolocation=()"
  );
  return parentHeaders;
}
```

### Setting

Sometimes it's important to overwrite the parent header. Do this with `set` instead of `append`:

```tsx
export function headers({ parentHeaders }: HeadersArgs) {
  parentHeaders.set(
    "Cache-Control",
    "max-age=3600, s-maxage=86400"
  );
  return parentHeaders;
}
```

You can avoid the need to merge headers by only defining headers in "leaf routes" (index routes and child routes without children) and not in parent routes.

## From `entry.server.tsx`

The `handleRequest` export receives the headers from the route module as an argument. You can append global headers here.

```tsx
export default function handleRequest(
  request,
  responseStatusCode,
  responseHeaders,
  routerContext,
  loadContext
) {
  // set, append global headers
  responseHeaders.set(
    "X-App-Version",
    routerContext.manifest.version
  );

  return new Response(await getStream(), {
    headers: responseHeaders,
    status: responseStatusCode,
  });
}
```

If you don't have an `entry.server.tsx` run the `reveal` command:

```shellscript nonumber
react-router reveal
```
---
title: File Uploads
---

# File Uploads

Handle file uploads in your React Router applications. This guide uses some packages from the [Remix The Web][remix-the-web] project to make file uploads easier.

_Thank you to David Adams for [writing an original guide](https://programmingarehard.com/2024/09/06/remix-file-uploads-updated.html/) on which this doc is based. You can refer to it for even more examples._

## Basic File Upload

### 1. Setup some routes

You can setup your routes however you like. This example uses the following structure:

```ts filename=routes.ts
import {
  type RouteConfig,
  route,
} from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
  // ... other routes
  route("user/:id", "pages/user-profile.tsx", [
    route("avatar", "api/avatar.tsx"),
  ]),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

### 2. Add the form data parser

`form-data-parser` is a wrapper around `request.formData()` that provides streaming support for handling file uploads.

```shellscript
npm i @mjackson/form-data-parser
```

[See the `form-data-parser` docs for more information][form-data-parser]

### 3. Create a route with an upload action

The `parseFormData` function takes an `uploadHandler` function as an argument. This function will be called for each file upload in the form.

<docs-warning>

You must set the form's `enctype` to `multipart/form-data` for file uploads to work.

</docs-warning>

```tsx filename=pages/user-profile.tsx
import {
  type FileUpload,
  parseFormData,
} from "@mjackson/form-data-parser";

export async function action({
  request,
}: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const uploadHandler = async (fileUpload: FileUpload) => {
    if (fileUpload.fieldName === "avatar") {
      // process the upload and return a File
    }
  };

  const formData = await parseFormData(
    request,
    uploadHandler
  );
  // 'avatar' has already been processed at this point
  const file = formData.get("avatar");
}

export default function Component() {
  return (
    <form method="post" encType="multipart/form-data">
      <input type="file" name="avatar" />
      <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

## Local Storage Implementation

### 1. Add the storage package

`file-storage` is a key/value interface for storing [File objects][file] in JavaScript. Similar to how `localStorage` allows you to store key/value pairs of strings in the browser, file-storage allows you to store key/value pairs of files on the server.

```shellscript
npm i @mjackson/file-storage
```

[See the `file-storage` docs for more information][file-storage]

### 2. Create a storage configuration

Create a file that exports a `LocalFileStorage` instance to be used by different routes.

```ts filename=avatar-storage.server.ts
import { LocalFileStorage } from "@mjackson/file-storage/local";

export const fileStorage = new LocalFileStorage(
  "./uploads/avatars"
);

export function getStorageKey(userId: string) {
  return `user-${userId}-avatar`;
}
```

### 3. Implement the upload handler

Update the form's `action` to store files in the `fileStorage` instance.

```tsx filename=pages/user-profile.tsx
import {
  type FileUpload,
  parseFormData,
} from "@mjackson/form-data-parser";
import {
  fileStorage,
  getStorageKey,
} from "~/avatar-storage.server";
import type { Route } from "./+types/user-profile";

export async function action({
  request,
  params,
}: Route.ActionArgs) {
  async function uploadHandler(fileUpload: FileUpload) {
    if (
      fileUpload.fieldName === "avatar" &&
      fileUpload.type.startsWith("image/")
    ) {
      let storageKey = getStorageKey(params.id);

      // FileUpload objects are not meant to stick around for very long (they are
      // streaming data from the request.body); store them as soon as possible.
      await fileStorage.set(storageKey, fileUpload);

      // Return a File for the FormData object. This is a LazyFile that knows how
      // to access the file's content if needed (using e.g. file.stream()) but
      // waits until it is requested to actually read anything.
      return fileStorage.get(storageKey);
    }
  }

  const formData = await parseFormData(
    request,
    uploadHandler
  );
}

export default function UserPage({
  actionData,
  params,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>User {params.id}</h1>
      <form
        method="post"
        // The form's enctype must be set to "multipart/form-data" for file uploads
        encType="multipart/form-data"
      >
        <input type="file" name="avatar" accept="image/*" />
        <button>Submit</button>
      </form>

      <img
        src={`/user/${params.id}/avatar`}
        alt="user avatar"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 4. Add a route to serve the uploaded file

Create a [resource route][resource-route] that streams the file as a response.

```tsx filename=api/avatar.tsx
import {
  fileStorage,
  getStorageKey,
} from "~/avatar-storage.server";
import type { Route } from "./+types/avatar";

export async function loader({ params }: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const storageKey = getStorageKey(params.id);
  const file = await fileStorage.get(storageKey);

  if (!file) {
    throw new Response("User avatar not found", {
      status: 404,
    });
  }

  return new Response(file.stream(), {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": file.type,
      "Content-Disposition": `attachment; filename=${file.name}`,
    },
  });
}
```

# Form Validation

This guide walks through a simple signup form implementation. You will likely want to pair these concepts with third-party validation libraries and error components, but this guide only focuses on the moving pieces for React Router.

## 1. Setting Up

We'll start by creating a basic signup route with form.

```ts filename=app/routes.ts
import {
  type RouteConfig,
  route,
} from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
  route("signup", "signup.tsx"),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

```tsx filename=signup.tsx
import type { Route } from "./+types/signup";
import { useFetcher } from "react-router";

export default function Signup(_: Route.ComponentProps) {
  let fetcher = useFetcher();
  return (
    <fetcher.Form method="post">
      <p>
        <input type="email" name="email" />
      </p>

      <p>
        <input type="password" name="password" />
      </p>

      <button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
    </fetcher.Form>
  );
}
```

## 2. Defining the Action

In this step, we'll define a server `action` in the same file as our `Signup` component. Note that the aim here is to provide a broad overview of the mechanics involved rather than digging deep into form validation rules or error object structures. We'll use rudimentary checks for the email and password to demonstrate the core concepts.

```tsx filename=signup.tsx
import type { Route } from "./+types/signup";
import { redirect, useFetcher, data } from "react-router";

export default function Signup(_: Route.ComponentProps) {
  // omitted for brevity
}

export async function action({
  request,
}: Route.ActionArgs) {
  const formData = await request.formData();
  const email = String(formData.get("email"));
  const password = String(formData.get("password"));

  const errors = {};

  if (!email.includes("@")) {
    errors.email = "Invalid email address";
  }

  if (password.length < 12) {
    errors.password =
      "Password should be at least 12 characters";
  }

  if (Object.keys(errors).length > 0) {
    return data({ errors }, { status: 400 });
  }

  // Redirect to dashboard if validation is successful
  return redirect("/dashboard");
}
```

If any validation errors are found, they are returned from the `action` to the fetcher. This is our way of signaling to the UI that something needs to be corrected, otherwise the user will be redirected to the dashboard.

Note the `data({ errors }, { status: 400 })` call. Setting a 400 status is the web standard way to signal to the client that there was a validation error (Bad Request). In React Router, only 200 status codes trigger page data revalidation so a 400 prevent that.

## 3. Displaying Validation Errors

Finally, we'll modify the `Signup` component to display validation errors, if any, from `fetcher.data`.

```tsx filename=signup.tsx lines=[3,8,13-15]
export default function Signup(_: Route.ComponentProps) {
  let fetcher = useFetcher();
  let errors = fetcher.data?.errors;
  return (
    <fetcher.Form method="post">
      <p>
        <input type="email" name="email" />
        {errors?.email ? <em>{errors.email}</em> : null}
      </p>

      <p>
        <input type="password" name="password" />
        {errors?.password ? (
          <em>{errors.password}</em>
        ) : null}
      </p>

      <button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
    </fetcher.Form>
  );
}
```

title: Using Fetchers
---

# Using Fetchers

Fetchers are useful for creating complex, dynamic user interfaces that require multiple, concurrent data interactions without causing a navigation.

Fetchers track their own, independent state and can be used to load data, mutate data, submit forms, and generally interact with loaders and actions.

## Calling Actions

The most common case for a fetcher is to submit data to an action, triggering a revalidation of route data. Consider the following route module:

```tsx
import { useLoaderData } from "react-router";

export async function clientLoader({ request }) {
  let title = localStorage.getItem("title") || "No Title";
  return { title };
}

export default function Component() {
  let data = useLoaderData();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 1. Add an action

First we'll add an action to the route for the fetcher to call:

```tsx lines=[7-11]
import { useLoaderData } from "react-router";

export async function clientLoader({ request }) {
  // ...
}

export async function clientAction({ request }) {
  await new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, 1000));
  let data = await request.formData();
  localStorage.setItem("title", data.get("title"));
  return { ok: true };
}

export default function Component() {
  let data = useLoaderData();
  // ...
}
```

### 2. Create a fetcher

Next create a fetcher and render a form with it:

```tsx lines=[7,12-14]
import { useLoaderData, useFetcher } from "react-router";

// ...

export default function Component() {
  let data = useLoaderData();
  let fetcher = useFetcher();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>

      <fetcher.Form method="post">
        <input type="text" name="title" />
      </fetcher.Form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 3. Submit the form

If you submit the form now, the fetcher will call the action and revalidate the route data automatically.

### 4. Render pending state

Fetchers make their state available during the async work so you can render pending UI the moment the user interacts:

```tsx lines=[10]
export default function Component() {
  let data = useLoaderData();
  let fetcher = useFetcher();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>

      <fetcher.Form method="post">
        <input type="text" name="title" />
        {fetcher.state !== "idle" && <p>Saving...</p>}
      </fetcher.Form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 5. Optimistic UI

Sometimes there's enough information in the form to render the next state immediately. You can access the form data with `fetcher.formData`:

```tsx lines=[3-4,8]
export default function Component() {
  let data = useLoaderData();
  let fetcher = useFetcher();
  let title = fetcher.formData?.get("title") || data.title;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>

      <fetcher.Form method="post">
        <input type="text" name="title" />
        {fetcher.state !== "idle" && <p>Saving...</p>}
      </fetcher.Form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 6. Fetcher Data and Validation

Data returned from an action is available in the fetcher's `data` property. This is primarily useful for returning error messages to the user for a failed mutation:

```tsx lines=[7-10,28-32]
// ...

export async function clientAction({ request }) {
  await new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, 1000));
  let data = await request.formData();

  let title = data.get("title") as string;
  if (title.trim() === "") {
    return { ok: false, error: "Title cannot be empty" };
  }

  localStorage.setItem("title", title);
  return { ok: true, error: null };
}

export default function Component() {
  let data = useLoaderData();
  let fetcher = useFetcher();
  let title = fetcher.formData?.get("title") || data.title;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>

      <fetcher.Form method="post">
        <input type="text" name="title" />
        {fetcher.state !== "idle" && <p>Saving...</p>}
        {fetcher.data?.error && (
          <p style={{ color: "red" }}>
            {fetcher.data.error}
          </p>
        )}
      </fetcher.Form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Loading Data

Another common use case for fetchers is to load data from a route for something like a combobox.

### 1. Create a search route

Consider the following route with a very basic search:

```tsx filename=./search-users.tsx
// { path: '/search-users', filename: './search-users.tsx' }
const users = [
  { id: 1, name: "Ryan" },
  { id: 2, name: "Michael" },
  // ...
];

export async function loader({ request }) {
  await new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, 300));
  let url = new URL(request.url);
  let query = url.searchParams.get("q");
  return users.filter((user) =>
    user.name.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())
  );
}
```

### 2. Render a fetcher in a combobox component

```tsx
import { useFetcher } from "react-router";

export function UserSearchCombobox() {
  let fetcher = useFetcher();
  return (
    <div>
      <fetcher.Form method="get" action="/search-users">
        <input type="text" name="q" />
      </fetcher.Form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- The action points to the route we created above: "/search-users"
- The name of the input is "q" to match the query parameter

### 3. Add type inference

```tsx lines=[2,5]
import { useFetcher } from "react-router";
import type { Search } from "./search-users";

export function UserSearchCombobox() {
  let fetcher = useFetcher<typeof Search.action>();
  // ...
}
```

Ensure you use `import type` so you only import the types.

### 4. Render the data

```tsx lines=[10-16]
import { useFetcher } from "react-router";

export function UserSearchCombobox() {
  let fetcher = useFetcher<typeof Search.action>();
  return (
    <div>
      <fetcher.Form method="get" action="/search-users">
        <input type="text" name="q" />
      </fetcher.Form>
      {fetcher.data && (
        <ul>
          {fetcher.data.map((user) => (
            <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Note you will need to hit "enter" to submit the form and see the results.

### 5. Render a pending state

```tsx lines=[12-14]
import { useFetcher } from "react-router";

export function UserSearchCombobox() {
  let fetcher = useFetcher<typeof Search.action>();
  return (
    <div>
      <fetcher.Form method="get" action="/search-users">
        <input type="text" name="q" />
      </fetcher.Form>
      {fetcher.data && (
        <ul
          style={{
            opacity: fetcher.state === "idle" ? 1 : 0.25,
          }}
        >
          {fetcher.data.map((user) => (
            <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 6. Search on user input

Fetchers can be submitted programmatically with `fetcher.submit`:

```tsx lines=[5-7]
<fetcher.Form method="get" action="/search-users">
  <input
    type="text"
    name="q"
    onChange={(event) => {
      fetcher.submit(event.currentTarget.form);
    }}
  />
</fetcher.Form>
```

Note the input event's form is passed as the first argument to `fetcher.submit`. The fetcher will use that form to submit the request, reading its attributes and serializing the data from its elements.

# Webhooks

Resource routes can be used to handle webhooks. For example, you can create a webhook that receives notifications from GitHub when a new commit is pushed to a repository:

```tsx
import type { Route } from "./+types/github";

import crypto from "node:crypto";

export const action = async ({
  request,
}: Route.ActionArgs) => {
  if (request.method !== "POST") {
    return Response.json(
      { message: "Method not allowed" },
      {
        status: 405,
      }
    );
  }
  const payload = await request.json();

  /* Validate the webhook */
  const signature = request.headers.get(
    "X-Hub-Signature-256"
  );
  const generatedSignature = `sha256=${crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", process.env.GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
    .update(JSON.stringify(payload))
    .digest("hex")}`;
  if (signature !== generatedSignature) {
    return Response.json(
      { message: "Signature mismatch" },
      {
        status: 401,
      }
    );
  }

  /* process the webhook (e.g. enqueue a background job) */

  return Response.json({ success: true });
};
```

# React Server Components

<docs-info>This feature is still in development and not yet available.</docs-info>

In the future, async components can be rendered in loaders like any other data:

```tsx filename=app/product-page.tsx
// route("products/:pid", "./product-page.tsx");
import type { Route } from "./+types/product";
import Product from "./product";
import Reviews from "./reviews";

export async function loader({ params }: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  return {
    product: <Product id={params.pid} />,
    reviews: <Reviews productId={params.pid} />,
  };
}

export default function ProductPage({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      {loaderData.product}
      <Suspense fallback={<div>loading...</div>}>
        {loaderData.reviews}
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```tsx filename=app/product.tsx
export async function Product({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const product = await fakeDb.getProduct(id);
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{product.title}</h1>
      <p>{product.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

title: Route Module Type Safety

# Route Module Type Safety

React Router generates route-specific types to power type inference for URL params, loader data, and more.
This guide will help you set it up if you didn't start with a template.

To learn more about how type safety works in React Router, check out [Type Safety Explanation](../explanation/type-safety).

## 1. Add `.react-router/` to `.gitignore`

React Router generates types into a `.react-router/` directory at the root of your app. This directory is fully managed by React Router and should be gitignore'd.

```txt
.react-router/
```

## 2. Include the generated types in tsconfig

Edit your tsconfig to get TypeScript to use the generated types. Additionally, `rootDirs` needs to be configured so the types can be imported as relative siblings to route modules.

```json filename=tsconfig.json
{
  "include": [".react-router/types/**/*"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDirs": [".", "./.react-router/types"]
  }
}
```

If you are using multiple `tsconfig` files for your app, you'll need to make these changes in whichever one `include`s your app directory.
For example, the [`node-custom-server` template](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router-templates/tree/390fcec476dd336c810280479688fe893da38713/node-custom-server) contains `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`, and `tsconfig.vite.json`. Since `tsconfig.vite.json` is the one that [includes the app directory](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router-templates/blob/390fcec476dd336c810280479688fe893da38713/node-custom-server/tsconfig.vite.json#L4-L6), that's the one that sets up `.react-router/types` for route module type safety.

## 3. Generate types before type checking

If you want to run type checking as its own command — for example, as part of your Continuous Integration pipeline — you'll need to make sure to generate types _before_ running typechecking:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "typecheck": "react-router typegen && tsc"
  }
}
```

## 4. Typing `AppLoadContext`

## Extending app `Context` types

To define your app's `context` type, add the following in a `.ts` or `.d.ts` file within your project:

```typescript
import "react-router";
declare module "react-router" {
  interface AppLoadContext {
    // add context properties here
  }
}
```

## 5. Type-only auto-imports (optional)

When auto-importing the `Route` type helper, TypeScript will generate:

```ts filename=app/routes/my-route.tsx
import { Route } from "./+types/my-route";
```

But if you enable [verbatimModuleSyntax](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#verbatimModuleSyntax):

```json filename=tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true
  }
}
```

Then, you will get the `type` modifier for the import automatically as well:

```ts filename=app/routes/my-route.tsx
import type { Route } from "./+types/my-route";
//     ^^^^
```

This helps tools like bundlers to detect type-only module that can be safely excluded from the bundle.

## Conclusion

React Router's Vite plugin should be automatically generating types into `.react-router/types/` anytime you edit your route config (`routes.ts`).
That means all you need to do is run `react-router dev` (or your custom dev server) to get to up-to-date types in your routes.

Check out our [Type Safety Explanation](../explanation/type-safety) for an example of how to pull in those types into your routes.

title: Streaming with Suspense
---

# Streaming with Suspense

Streaming with React Suspense allows apps to speed up initial renders by deferring non-critical data and unblocking UI rendering.

React Router supports React Suspense by returning promises from loaders and actions.

## 1. Return a promise from loader

React Router awaits route loaders before rendering route components. To unblock the loader for non-critical data, return the promise instead of awaiting it in the loader.

```tsx
import type { Route } from "./+types/my-route";

export async function loader({}: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  // note this is NOT awaited
  let nonCriticalData = new Promise((res) =>
    setTimeout(() => res("non-critical"), 5000)
  );

  let criticalData = await new Promise((res) =>
    setTimeout(() => res("critical"), 300)
  );

  return { nonCriticalData, criticalData };
}
```

## 2. Render the fallback and resolved UI

The promise will be available on `loaderData`, `<Await>` will await the promise and trigger `<Suspense>` to render the fallback UI.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Await } from "react-router";

// [previous code]

export default function MyComponent({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  let { criticalData, nonCriticalData } = loaderData;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Streaming example</h1>
      <h2>Critical data value: {criticalData}</h2>

      <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <Await resolve={nonCriticalData}>
          {(value) => <h3>Non critical value: {value}</h3>}
        </Await>
      </React.Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## With React 19

If you're experimenting with React 19, you can use `React.use` instead of `Await`, but you'll need to create a new component and pass the promise down to trigger the suspense fallback.

```tsx
<React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <NonCriticalUI p={nonCriticalData} />
</React.Suspense>
```

```tsx
function NonCriticalUI({ p }: { p: Promise<string> }) {
  let value = React.use(p);
  return <h3>Non critical value {value}</h3>;
}
```

title: Client Data
---

# Client Data

You can fetch and mutate data directly in the browser using `clientLoader` and `clientAction` functions.

These functions are the primary mechanism for data handling when using [SPA mode][spa]. This guide demonstrates common use cases for leveraging client data in Server-Side Rendering (SSR).

## Skip the Server Hop

When using React Router with a Backend-For-Frontend (BFF) architecture, you might want to bypass the React Router server and communicate directly with your backend API. This approach requires proper authentication handling and assumes no CORS restrictions. Here's how to implement this:

1. Load the data from server `loader` on the document load
2. Load the data from the `clientLoader` on all subsequent loads

In this scenario, React Router will _not_ call the `clientLoader` on hydration - and will only call it on subsequent navigations.

```tsx lines=[4,11]
export async function loader({
  request,
}: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const data = await fetchApiFromServer({ request }); // (1)
  return data;
}

export async function clientLoader({
  request,
}: Route.ClientLoaderArgs) {
  const data = await fetchApiFromClient({ request }); // (2)
  return data;
}
```

## Fullstack State

Sometimes you need to combine data from both the server and browser (like IndexedDB or browser SDKs) before rendering a component. Here's how to implement this pattern:

1. Load the partial data from server `loader` on the document load
2. Export a [`HydrateFallback`][hydratefallback] component to render during SSR because we don't yet have a full set of data
3. Set `clientLoader.hydrate = true`, this instructs React Router to call the clientLoader as part of initial document hydration
4. Combine the server data with the client data in `clientLoader`

```tsx lines=[4-6,19-20,23,26]
export async function loader({
  request,
}: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const partialData = await getPartialDataFromDb({
    request,
  }); // (1)
  return partialData;
}

export async function clientLoader({
  request,
  serverLoader,
}: Route.ClientLoaderArgs) {
  const [serverData, clientData] = await Promise.all([
    serverLoader(),
    getClientData(request),
  ]);
  return {
    ...serverData, // (4)
    ...clientData, // (4)
  };
}
clientLoader.hydrate = true as const; // (3)

export function HydrateFallback() {
  return <p>Skeleton rendered during SSR</p>; // (2)
}

export default function Component({
  // This will always be the combined set of server + client data
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  return <>...</>;
}
```

## Choosing Server or Client Data Loading

You can mix data loading strategies across your application, choosing between server-only or client-only data loading for each route. Here's how to implement both approaches:

1. Export a `loader` when you want to use server data
2. Export `clientLoader` and a `HydrateFallback` when you want to use client data

A route that only depends on a server loader looks like this:

```tsx filename=app/routes/server-data-route.tsx
export async function loader({
  request,
}: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const data = await getServerData(request);
  return data;
}

export default function Component({
  loaderData, // (1) - server data
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  return <>...</>;
}
```

A route that only depends on a client loader looks like this.

```tsx filename=app/routes/client-data-route.tsx
export async function clientLoader({
  request,
}: Route.ClientLoaderArgs) {
  const clientData = await getClientData(request);
  return clientData;
}
// Note: you do not have to set this explicitly - it is implied if there is no `loader`
clientLoader.hydrate = true;

// (2)
export function HydrateFallback() {
  return <p>Skeleton rendered during SSR</p>;
}

export default function Component({
  loaderData, // (2) - client data
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  return <>...</>;
}
```

## Client-Side Caching

You can implement client-side caching (using memory, localStorage, etc.) to optimize server requests. Here's a pattern that demonstrates cache management:

1. Load the data from server `loader` on the document load
2. Set `clientLoader.hydrate = true` to prime the cache
3. Load subsequent navigations from the cache via `clientLoader`
4. Invalidate the cache in your `clientAction`

Note that since we are not exporting a `HydrateFallback` component, we will SSR the route component and then run the `clientLoader` on hydration, so it's important that your `loader` and `clientLoader` return the same data on initial load to avoid hydration errors.

```tsx lines=[4,26,32,39,46]
export async function loader({
  request,
}: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const data = await getDataFromDb({ request }); // (1)
  return data;
}

export async function action({
  request,
}: Route.ActionArgs) {
  await saveDataToDb({ request });
  return { ok: true };
}

let isInitialRequest = true;

export async function clientLoader({
  request,
  serverLoader,
}: Route.ClientLoaderArgs) {
  const cacheKey = generateKey(request);

  if (isInitialRequest) {
    isInitialRequest = false;
    const serverData = await serverLoader();
    cache.set(cacheKey, serverData); // (2)
    return serverData;
  }

  const cachedData = await cache.get(cacheKey);
  if (cachedData) {
    return cachedData; // (3)
  }

  const serverData = await serverLoader();
  cache.set(cacheKey, serverData);
  return serverData;
}
clientLoader.hydrate = true; // (2)

export async function clientAction({
  request,
  serverAction,
}: Route.ClientActionArgs) {
  const cacheKey = generateKey(request);
  cache.delete(cacheKey); // (4)
  const serverData = await serverAction();
  return serverData;
}
```

title: Revalidation Optimization
hidden: true
---

[copy pasted]

During client-side transitions, React Router will optimize reloading of routes that are already rendering, like not reloading layout routes that aren't changing. In other cases, like form submissions or search param changes, React Router doesn't know which routes need to be reloaded, so it reloads them all to be safe. This ensures your UI always stays in sync with the state on your server.

This function lets apps further optimize by returning `false` when React Router is about to reload a route. If you define this function on a route module, React Router will defer to your function on every navigation and every revalidation after an action is called. Again, this makes it possible for your UI to get out of sync with your server if you do it wrong, so be careful.

`fetcher.load` calls also revalidate, but because they load a specific URL, they don't have to worry about route param or URL search param revalidations. `fetcher.load`'s only revalidate by default after action submissions and explicit revalidation requests via [`useRevalidator`][use-revalidator].

title: View Transitions

# View Transitions

Enable smooth animations between page transitions in your React Router applications using the [View Transitions API][view-transitions-api]. This feature allows you to create seamless visual transitions during client-side navigation.

## Basic View Transition

### 1. Enable view transitions on navigation

The simplest way to enable view transitions is by adding the `viewTransition` prop to your `Link`, `NavLink`, or `Form` components. This automatically wraps the navigation update in `document.startViewTransition()`.

```tsx
<Link to="/about" viewTransition>
  About
</Link>
```

Without any additional CSS, this provides a basic cross-fade animation between pages.

For more information on using the View Transitions API, please refer to the ["Smooth transitions with the View Transition API" guide][view-transitions-guide] from the Google Chrome team.

## Image Gallery Example

Let's build an image gallery that demonstrates how to trigger and use view transitions. We'll create a list of images that expand into a detail view with smooth animations.

### 2. Create the image gallery route

```tsx filename=routes/image-gallery.tsx
import { NavLink } from "react-router";

export const images = [
  "https://remix.run/blog-images/headers/the-future-is-now.jpg",
  "https://remix.run/blog-images/headers/waterfall.jpg",
  "https://remix.run/blog-images/headers/webpack.png",
  // ... more images ...
];

export default function ImageGalleryRoute() {
  return (
    <div className="image-list">
      <h1>Image List</h1>
      <div>
        {images.map((src, idx) => (
          <NavLink
            key={src}
            to={`/image/${idx}`}
            viewTransition // Enable view transitions for this link
          >
            <p>Image Number {idx}</p>
            <img
              className="max-w-full contain-layout"
              src={src}
            />
          </NavLink>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 3. Add transition styles

Define view transition names and animations for elements that should transition smoothly between routes.

```css filename=app.css
/* Layout styles for the image grid */
.image-list > div {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  column-gap: 10px;
}

.image-list h1 {
  font-size: 2rem;
  font-weight: 600;
}

.image-list img {
  max-width: 100%;
  contain: layout;
}

.image-list p {
  width: fit-content;
}

/* Assign transition names to elements during navigation */
.image-list a.transitioning img {
  view-transition-name: image-expand;
}

.image-list a.transitioning p {
  view-transition-name: image-title;
}
```

### 4. Create the image detail route

The detail view needs to use the same view transition names to create a seamless animation.

```tsx filename=routes/image-details.tsx
import { Link } from "react-router";
import { images } from "./home";
import type { Route } from "./+types/image-details";

export default function ImageDetailsRoute({
  params,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  return (
    <div className="image-detail">
      <Link to="/" viewTransition>
        Back
      </Link>
      <h1>Image Number {params.id}</h1>
      <img src={images[Number(params.id)]} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 5. Add matching transition styles for the detail view

```css filename=app.css
/* Match transition names from the list view */
.image-detail h1 {
  font-size: 2rem;
  font-weight: 600;
  width: fit-content;
  view-transition-name: image-title;
}

.image-detail img {
  max-width: 100%;
  contain: layout;
  view-transition-name: image-expand;
}
```

## Advanced Usage

You can control view transitions more precisely using either render props or the `useViewTransitionState` hook.

### 1. Using render props

```tsx filename=routes/image-gallery.tsx
<NavLink to={`/image/${idx}`} viewTransition>
  {({ isTransitioning }) => (
    <>
      <p
        style={{
          viewTransitionName: isTransitioning
            ? "image-title"
            : "none",
        }}
      >
        Image Number {idx}
      </p>
      <img
        src={src}
        style={{
          viewTransitionName: isTransitioning
            ? "image-expand"
            : "none",
        }}
      />
    </>
  )}
</NavLink>
```

### 2. Using the `useViewTransitionState` hook

```tsx filename=routes/image-gallery.tsx
function NavImage(props: { src: string; idx: number }) {
  const href = `/image/${props.idx}`;
  // Hook provides transition state for specific route
  const isTransitioning = useViewTransitionState(href);

  return (
    <Link to={href} viewTransition>
      <p
        style={{
          viewTransitionName: isTransitioning
            ? "image-title"
            : "none",
        }}
      >
        Image Number {props.idx}
      </p>
      <img
        src={props.src}
        style={{
          viewTransitionName: isTransitioning
            ? "image-expand"
            : "none",
        }}
      />
    </Link>
  );
}
```

When using React Router as a framework, you can enable "SPA Mode" by setting `ssr:false` in your `react-router.config.ts` file. This will disable runtime server rendering and generate an `index.html` at build time that you can serve and hydrate as a SPA.

Typical Single Page apps send a mostly blank `index.html` template with little more than an empty `<div id="root"></div>`. In contrast, `react-router build` (in SPA Mode) pre-renders your root route at build time into an `index.html` file. This means you can:

- Send more than an empty `<div>`
- Use a root `loader` to load data for your application shell
- Use React components to generate the initial page users see (root `HydrateFallback`)
- Re-enable server rendering later without changing anything about your UI

It's important to note that setting `ssr:false` only disables _runtime server rendering_. React Router will still server render your root route at _build time_ to generate the `index.html` file. This is why your project still needs a dependency on `@react-router/node` and your routes need to be SSR-safe. That means you can't call `window` or other browser-only APIs during the initial render, even when server rendering is disabled.

<docs-info>SPA Mode is a special form of "Pre-Rendering" that allows you to serve all paths in your application from the same HTML file. Please refer to the [Pre-Rendering](./pre-rendering) guide if you want to do more extensive pre-rendering.</docs-info>

## 1. Disable Runtime Server Rendering

Server rendering is enabled by default. Set the `ssr` flag to `false` in `react-router.config.ts` to disable it.

```ts filename=react-router.config.ts lines=[4]
import { type Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";

export default {
  ssr: false,
} satisfies Config;
```

With this set to false, the server build will no longer be generated.

<docs-info>It's important to note that setting `ssr:false` only disables _runtime server rendering_. React Router will still server render your root route at _build time_ to generate the `index.html` file. This is why your project still needs a dependency on `@react-router/node` and your routes need to be SSR-safe. That means you can't call `window` or other browser-only APIs during the initial render, even when server rendering is disabled.</docs-info>

## 2. Add a `HydrateFallback` and optional `loader` to your root route

SPA Mode will generate an `index.html` file at build-time that you can serve as the entry point for your SPA. This will only render the root route so that it is capable of hydrating at runtime for any path in your application.

To provide a better loading UI than an empty `<div>`, you can add a `HydrateFallback` component to your root route to render your loading UI into the `index.html` at build time. This way, it will be shown to users immediately while the SPA is loading/hydrating.

```tsx filename=root.tsx lines=[7-9]
import LoadingScreen from "./components/loading-screen";

export function Layout() {
  return <html>{/*...*/}</html>;
}

export function HydrateFallback() {
  return <LoadingScreen />;
}

export default function App() {
  return <Outlet />;
}
```

Because the root route is server-rendered at build time, you can also use a `loader` in your root route if you choose. This `loader` will be called at build time and the data will be available via the optional `HydrateFallback` `loaderData` prop.

```tsx filename=root.tsx lines=[5,10,14]
import { Route } from "./+types/root";

export async function loader() {
  return {
    version: await getVersion(),
  };
}

export function HydrateFallback({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Loading version {loaderData.version}...</h1>
      <AwesomeSpinner />
    </div>
  );
}
```

You cannot include a `loader` in any other routes in your app when using SPA Mode unless you are [pre-rendering those pages](./pre-rendering).

## 3. Use client loaders and client actions

With server rendering disabled, you can still use `clientLoader` and `clientAction` to manage route data and mutations.

```tsx filename=some-route.tsx
import { Route } from "./+types/some-route";

export async function clientLoader({
  params,
}: Route.ClientLoaderArgs) {
  let data = await fetch(`/some/api/stuff/${params.id}`);
  return data;
}

export async function clientAction({
  request,
}: Route.ClientActionArgs) {
  let formData = await request.formData();
  return await processPayment(formData);
}
```

## 4. Direct all URLs to index.html

After running `react-router build`, deploy the `build/client` directory to whatever static host you prefer.

Common to deploying any SPA, you'll need to configure your host to direct all URLs to the `index.html` of the client build. Some hosts do this by default, but others don't. As an example, a host may support a `_redirects` file to do this:

```
/*    /index.html   200
```

If you're getting 404s at valid routes for your app, it's likely you need to configure your host.

title: Error Boundaries
---

# Error Boundaries

To avoid rendering an empty page to users, route modules will automatically catch errors in your code and render the closest `ErrorBoundary`.

Error boundaries are not intended for error reporting or rendering form validation errors. Please see [Form Validation](./form-validation) and [Error Reporting](./error-reporting) instead.

## 1. Add a root error boundary

All applications should at a minimum export a root error boundary. This one handles the three main cases:

- Thrown `data` with a status code and text
- Instances of errors with a stack trace
- Randomly thrown values

```tsx filename=root.tsx
import { Route } from "./+types/root";

export function ErrorBoundary({
  error,
}: Route.ErrorBoundaryProps) {
  if (isRouteErrorResponse(error)) {
    return (
      <>
        <h1>
          {error.status} {error.statusText}
        </h1>
        <p>{error.data}</p>
      </>
    );
  } else if (error instanceof Error) {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Error</h1>
        <p>{error.message}</p>
        <p>The stack trace is:</p>
        <pre>{error.stack}</pre>
      </div>
    );
  } else {
    return <h1>Unknown Error</h1>;
  }
}
```

## 2. Write a bug

It's not recommended to intentionally throw errors to force the error boundary to render as a means of control flow. Error Boundaries are primarily for catching unintentional errors in your code.

```tsx
export async function loader() {
  return undefined();
}
```

This will render the `instanceof Error` branch of the UI from step 1.

This is not just for loaders, but for all route module APIs: loaders, actions, components, headers, links, and meta.

## 3. Throw data in loaders/actions

There are exceptions to the rule in #2, especially 404s. You can intentionally `throw data()` (with a proper status code) to the closest error boundary when your loader can't find what it needs to render the page. Throw a 404 and move on.

```tsx
import { data } from "react-router";

export async function loader({ params }) {
  let record = await fakeDb.getRecord(params.id);
  if (!record) {
    throw data("Record Not Found", { status: 404 });
  }
  return record;
}
```

This will render the `isRouteErrorResponse` branch of the UI from step 1.

## 4. Nested error boundaries

When an error is thrown, the "closest error boundary" will be rendered. Consider these nested routes:

```tsx filename="routes.ts"
// ✅ has error boundary
route("/app", "app.tsx", [
  // ❌ no error boundary
  route("invoices", "invoices.tsx", [
    // ✅ has error boundary
    route("invoices/:id", "invoice-page.tsx", [
      // ❌ no error boundary
      route("payments", "payments.tsx"),
    ]),
  ]),
]);
```

The following table shows which error boundary will render given the origin of the error:

| error origin     | rendered boundary |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| app.tsx          | app.tsx           |
| invoices.tsx     | app.tsx           |
| invoice-page.tsx | invoice-page.tsx  |
| payments.tsx     | invoice-page.tsx  |

## Error Sanitization

In production mode, any errors that happen on the server are automatically sanitized before being sent to the browser to prevent leaking any sensitive server information (like stack traces).

This means that a thrown `Error` will have a generic message and no stack trace in production in the browser. The original error is untouched on the server.

Also note that data sent with `throw data(yourData)` is not sanitized as the data there is intended to be rendered.

# React Router Home

React Router is a multi-strategy router for React bridging the gap from React 18 to React 19. You can use it maximally as a React framework or as minimally as you want.

## Getting Started

There are three primary ways, or "modes", to use it in your app, so there are three guides to get you started.

- [Declarative](./start/declarative/installation)
- [Data](./start/data/custom)
- [Framework](./start/framework/installation)

Learn which mode is right for you in [Picking a Mode](./start/modes).

## Using These Guides

Across the docs you'll see the following icons:

[MODES: framework, data, declarative]

<p></p>

These icons indicate which mode the content is relevant to.

Additional auto-generated reference documentation is available:

[Autogenerated Reference Docs ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/modules/react_router.html)

## Upgrading

If you are caught up on future flags, upgrading from React Router v6 or Remix v2 is generally non-breaking. Remix v2 apps are encouraged to upgrade to React Router v7.

# createSearchParams

[MODES: framework, data, declarative]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.createSearchParams.html)

Creates a URLSearchParams object using the given initializer.

This is identical to `new URLSearchParams(init)` except it also
supports arrays as values in the object form of the initializer
instead of just strings. This is convenient when you need multiple
values for a given key, but don't want to use an array initializer.

For example, instead of:

```tsx
let searchParams = new URLSearchParams([
  ["sort", "name"],
  ["sort", "price"],
]);
```

you can do:

```
let searchParams = createSearchParams({
  sort: ['name', 'price']
});

# Form

[MODES: framework, data]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.Form.html)

A progressively enhanced HTML [`<form>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) that submits data to actions via `fetch`, activating pending states in `useNavigation` which enables advanced user interfaces beyond a basic HTML form. After a form's action completes, all data on the page is automatically revalidated to keep the UI in sync with the data.

Because it uses the HTML form API, server rendered pages are interactive at a basic level before JavaScript loads. Instead of React Router managing the submission, the browser manages the submission as well as the pending states (like the spinning favicon). After JavaScript loads, React Router takes over enabling web application user experiences.

Form is most useful for submissions that should also change the URL or otherwise add an entry to the browser history stack. For forms that shouldn't manipulate the browser history stack, use [`<fetcher.Form>`][fetcher_form].

```tsx
import { Form } from "react-router";

function NewEvent() {
  return (
    <Form action="/events" method="post">
      <input name="title" type="text" />
      <input name="description" type="text" />
    </Form>
  );
}
```

## Props

### action

[modes: framework, data]

The URL to submit the form data to. If `undefined`, this defaults to the closest route in context.

### discover

[modes: framework, data]

Determines application manifest discovery behavior.

### encType

[modes: framework, data]

The encoding type to use for the form submission.

### fetcherKey

[modes: framework, data]

Indicates a specific fetcherKey to use when using `navigate={false}` so you
can pick up the fetcher's state in a different component in a [useFetcher](../hooks/useFetcher).

### method

[modes: framework, data]

The HTTP verb to use when the form is submitted. Supports "get", "post",
"put", "delete", and "patch".

Native `<form>` only supports `get` and `post`, avoid the other verbs if
you'd like to support progressive enhancement

### navigate

[modes: framework, data]

Skips the navigation and uses a [useFetcher](../hooks/useFetcher) internally
when `false`. This is essentially a shorthand for `useFetcher()` +
`<fetcher.Form>` where you don't care about the resulting data in this
component.

### onSubmit

[modes: framework, data]

A function to call when the form is submitted. If you call
`event.preventDefault()` then this form will not do anything.

### preventScrollReset

[modes: framework, data]

Prevent the scroll position from resetting to the top of the viewport on
completion of the navigation when using the <ScrollRestoration> component

### relative

[modes: framework, data]

Determines whether the form action is relative to the route hierarchy or
the pathname. Use this if you want to opt out of navigating the route
hierarchy and want to instead route based on /-delimited URL segments

### reloadDocument

[modes: framework, data]

Forces a full document navigation instead of client side routing + data
fetch.

### replace

[modes: framework, data]

Replaces the current entry in the browser history stack when the form
navigates. Use this if you don't want the user to be able to click "back"
to the page with the form on it.

### state

[modes: framework, data]

State object to add to the history stack entry for this navigation

### viewTransition

[modes: framework, data]

Enables a [View
Transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API)
for this navigation. To apply specific styles during the transition see
[useViewTransitionState](../hooks/useViewTransitionState).
---
title: Await
---

# Await

[MODES: framework, data]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.Await.html)

Used to render promise values with automatic error handling.

```tsx
import { Await, useLoaderData } from "react-router";

export function loader() {
  // not awaited
  const reviews = getReviews();
  // awaited (blocks the transition)
  const book = await fetch("/api/book").then((res) =>
    res.json()
  );
  return { book, reviews };
}

function Book() {
  const { book, reviews } = useLoaderData();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{book.title}</h1>
      <p>{book.description}</p>
      <React.Suspense fallback={<ReviewsSkeleton />}>
        <Await
          resolve={reviews}
          errorElement={
            <div>Could not load reviews 😬</div>
          }
          children={(resolvedReviews) => (
            <Reviews items={resolvedReviews} />
          )}
        />
      </React.Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

`<Await>` expects to be rendered inside of a `<React.Suspense>`

## Props

### children

[modes: framework, data]

When using a function, the resolved value is provided as the parameter.

```tsx [2]
<Await resolve={reviewsPromise}>
  {(resolvedReviews) => <Reviews items={resolvedReviews} />}
</Await>
```

When using React elements, [useAsyncValue](../hooks/useAsyncValue) will provide the
resolved value:

```tsx [2]
<Await resolve={reviewsPromise}>
  <Reviews />
</Await>;

function Reviews() {
  const resolvedReviews = useAsyncValue();
  return <div>...</div>;
}
```

### errorElement

[modes: framework, data]

The error element renders instead of the children when the promise rejects.

```tsx
<Await
  errorElement={<div>Oops</div>}
  resolve={reviewsPromise}
>
  <Reviews />
</Await>
```

To provide a more contextual error, you can use the [useAsyncError](../hooks/useAsyncError) in a
child component

```tsx
<Await
  errorElement={<ReviewsError />}
  resolve={reviewsPromise}
>
  <Reviews />
</Await>;

function ReviewsError() {
  const error = useAsyncError();
  return <div>Error loading reviews: {error.message}</div>;
}
```

If you do not provide an errorElement, the rejected value will bubble up to
the nearest route-level ErrorBoundary and be accessible
via [useRouteError](../hooks/useRouteError) hook.

### resolve

[modes: framework, data]

Takes a promise returned from a [LoaderFunction](../Other/LoaderFunction) value to be resolved and rendered.

```jsx
import { useLoaderData, Await } from "react-router";

export async function loader() {
  let reviews = getReviews(); // not awaited
  let book = await getBook();
  return {
    book,
    reviews, // this is a promise
  };
}

export default function Book() {
  const {
    book,
    reviews, // this is the same promise
  } = useLoaderData();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{book.title}</h1>
      <p>{book.description}</p>
      <React.Suspense fallback={<ReviewsSkeleton />}>
        <Await
          // and is the promise we pass to Await
          resolve={reviews}
        >
          <Reviews />
        </Await>
      </React.Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```
---
title: Meta

# Meta

[MODES: framework]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.Meta.html)

Renders all the `<meta>` tags created by route module [`meta`](../../start/framework/route-module#meta) export. You should render it inside the `<head>` of your HTML.

```tsx
import { Meta } from "react-router";

export default function Root() {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <Meta />
      </head>
    </html>
  );
}
```

# Routes

[MODES: framework, data, declarative]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.Routes.html)

Renders a branch of [Route](../components/Route) that best matches the current
location. Note that these routes do not participate in data loading, actions,
code splitting, or any other route module features.

```tsx
import { Routes, Route } from "react-router"

<Routes>
 <Route index element={<StepOne />} />
 <Route path="step-2" element={<StepTwo />} />
 <Route path="step-3" element={<StepThree />}>
</Routes>
```

## Props

### children

[modes: framework, data, declarative]

Nested [Route](../components/Route) elements

### location

[modes: framework, data, declarative]

The location to match against. Defaults to the current location.

title: PrefetchPageLinks
---

# PrefetchPageLinks

[MODES: framework]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.PrefetchPageLinks.html)

Renders `<link rel=prefetch|modulepreload>` tags for modules and data of another page to enable an instant navigation to that page. `<Link prefetch>` uses this internally, but you can render it to prefetch a page for any other reason.

```tsx
import { PrefetchPageLinks } from "react-router";

<PrefetchPageLinks page="/absolute/path" />;
```

For example, you may render one of this as the user types into a search field to prefetch search results before they click through to their selection.

## Props

### crossOrigin

[modes: framework]

How the element handles crossorigin requests

### disabled

[modes: framework]

Whether the link is disabled

### hrefLang

[modes: framework]

Language of the linked resource

### integrity

[modes: framework]

Integrity metadata used in Subresource Integrity checks

### media

[modes: framework]

Applicable media: "screen", "print", "(max-width: 764px)"

### page

[modes: framework]

The absolute path of the page to prefetch.

### referrerPolicy

[modes: framework]

Referrer policy for fetches initiated by the element
---
title: Scripts
---

# Scripts

[MODES: framework]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.Scripts.html)

Renders the client runtime of your app. It should be rendered inside the `<body>` of the document.

```tsx
import { Scripts } from "react-router";

export default function Root() {
  return (
    <html>
      <head />
      <body>
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

If server rendering, you can omit `<Scripts/>` and the app will work as a traditional web app without JavaScript, relying solely on HTML and browser behaviors.

## Props

### ScriptsProps

[modes: framework]

A couple common attributes:

- `<Scripts crossOrigin>` for hosting your static assets on a different server than your app.
- `<Scripts nonce>` to support a [content security policy for scripts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src) with [nonce-sources](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/Sources#sources) for your `<script>` tags.

You cannot pass through attributes such as `async`, `defer`, `src`, `type`, `noModule` because they are managed by React Router internally.
---
title: NavLink
---

# NavLink

[MODES: framework, data, declarative]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.NavLink.html)

Wraps [Link](../components/Link) with additional props for styling active and pending states.

- Automatically applies classes to the link based on its active and pending states, see NavLinkProps.className.
- Automatically applies `aria-current="page"` to the link when the link is active. See [`aria-current`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-current) on MDN.

```tsx
import { NavLink } from "react-router";
<NavLink to="/message" />;
```

States are available through the className, style, and children render props. See [NavLinkRenderProps](../Other/NavLinkRenderProps).

```tsx
<NavLink
  to="/messages"
  className={({ isActive, isPending }) =>
    isPending ? "pending" : isActive ? "active" : ""
  }
>
  Messages
</NavLink>
```

## Props

### caseSensitive

[modes: framework, data, declarative]

Changes the matching logic to make it case-sensitive:

| Link                                         | URL           | isActive |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| `<NavLink to="/SpOnGe-bOB" />`               | `/sponge-bob` | true     |
| `<NavLink to="/SpOnGe-bOB" caseSensitive />` | `/sponge-bob` | false    |

### children

[modes: framework, data, declarative]

Can be regular React children or a function that receives an object with the active and pending states of the link.

```tsx
<NavLink to="/tasks">
  {({ isActive }) => (
    <span className={isActive ? "active" : ""}>Tasks</span>
  )}
</NavLink>
```

### className

[modes: framework, data, declarative]

Classes are automatically applied to NavLink that correspond to the state.

```css
a.active {
  color: red;
}
a.pending {
  color: blue;
}
a.transitioning {
  view-transition-name: my-transition;
}
```

Note that `pending` is only available with Framework and Data modes.

### discover

[modes: framework]

Defines the link discovery behavior

```tsx
<Link discover="render" />
```

- **render** - default, discover the route when the link renders
- **none** - don't eagerly discover, only discover if the link is clicked

### end

[modes: framework, data, declarative]

Changes the matching logic for the `active` and `pending` states to only match to the "end" of the NavLinkProps.to. If the URL is longer, it will no longer be considered active.

| Link                          | URL          | isActive |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| `<NavLink to="/tasks" />`     | `/tasks`     | true     |
| `<NavLink to="/tasks" />`     | `/tasks/123` | true     |
| `<NavLink to="/tasks" end />` | `/tasks`     | true     |
| `<NavLink to="/tasks" end />` | `/tasks/123` | false    |

`<NavLink to="/">` is an exceptional case because _every_ URL matches `/`. To avoid this matching every single route by default, it effectively ignores the `end` prop and only matches when you're at the root route.

### prefetch

[modes: framework]

Defines the data and module prefetching behavior for the link.

```tsx
<Link prefetch="intent" />
```

- **none** - default, no prefetching
- **intent** - prefetches when the user hovers or focuses the link
- **render** - prefetches when the link renders
- **viewport** - prefetches when the link is in the viewport, very useful for mobile

Prefetching is done with HTML `<link rel="prefetch">` tags. They are inserted after the link.

```tsx
<a href="..." />
<a href="..." />
<link rel="prefetch" /> // might conditionally render
```

Because of this, if you are using `nav :last-child` you will need to use `nav :last-of-type` so the styles don't conditionally fall off your last link (and any other similar selectors).

### preventScrollReset

[modes: framework, data]

Prevents the scroll position from being reset to the top of the window when the link is clicked and the app is using [ScrollRestoration](../components/ScrollRestoration). This only prevents new locations reseting scroll to the top, scroll position will be restored for back/forward button navigation.

```tsx
<Link to="?tab=one" preventScrollReset />
```

### relative

[modes: framework, data, declarative]

Defines the relative path behavior for the link.

```tsx
<Link to=".." /> // default: "route"
<Link relative="route" />
<Link relative="path" />
```

Consider a route hierarchy where a parent route pattern is "blog" and a child route pattern is "blog/:slug/edit".

- **route** - default, resolves the link relative to the route pattern. In the example above a relative link of `".."` will remove both `:slug/edit` segments back to "/blog".
- **path** - relative to the path so `..` will only remove one URL segment up to "/blog/:slug"

### reloadDocument

[modes: framework, data, declarative]

Will use document navigation instead of client side routing when the link is clicked: the browser will handle the transition normally (as if it were an `<a href>`).

```tsx
<Link to="/logout" reloadDocument />
```

### replace

[modes: framework, data, declarative]

Replaces the current entry in the history stack instead of pushing a new one onto it.

```tsx
<Link replace />
```

```
# with a history stack like this
A -> B

# normal link click pushes a new entry
A -> B -> C

# but with `replace`, B is replaced by C
A -> C
```

### state

[modes: framework, data, declarative]

Adds persistent client side routing state to the next location.

```tsx
<Link to="/somewhere/else" state={{ some: "value" }} />
```

The location state is accessed from the `location`.

```tsx
function SomeComp() {
  const location = useLocation();
  location.state; // { some: "value" }
}
```

This state is inaccessible on the server as it is implemented on top of [`history.state`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/state)

### style

[modes: framework, data, declarative]

Regular React style object or a function that receives an object with the active and pending states of the link.

```tsx
<NavLink to="/tasks" style={{ color: "red" }} />
<NavLink to="/tasks" style={({ isActive, isPending }) => ({
  color:
    isActive ? "red" :
    isPending ? "blue" : "black"
})} />
```

Note that `pending` is only available with Framework and Data modes.

### to

[modes: framework, data, declarative]

Can be a string or a partial [Path](../Other/Path):

```tsx
<Link to="/some/path" />

<Link
  to={{
    pathname: "/some/path",
    search: "?query=string",
    hash: "#hash",
  }}
/>
```

### viewTransition

[modes: framework, data, declarative]

Enables a [View Transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API) for this navigation.

```jsx
<Link to={to} viewTransition>
  Click me
</Link>
```

To apply specific styles for the transition, see [useViewTransitionState](../hooks/useViewTransitionState)

# Links

[MODES: framework]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.Links.html)

Renders all of the `<link>` tags created by route module [`links`](../../start/framework/route-module#links) export. You should render it inside the `<head>` of your document.

```tsx
import { Links } from "react-router";

export default function Root() {
  return (

# ScrollRestoration

[MODES: framework, data]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.ScrollRestoration.html)

Emulates the browser's scroll restoration on location changes. Apps should only render one of these, right before the [Scripts](../components/Scripts) component.

```tsx
import { ScrollRestoration } from "react-router";

export default function Root() {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <ScrollRestoration />
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

This component renders an inline `<script>` to prevent scroll flashing. The `nonce` prop will be passed down to the script tag to allow CSP nonce usage.

```tsx
<ScrollRestoration nonce={cspNonce} />
```

## Props

### ScriptsProps

[modes: framework, data]

A couple common attributes:

- `<Scripts crossOrigin>` for hosting your static assets on a different server than your app.
- `<Scripts nonce>` to support a [content security policy for scripts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src) with [nonce-sources](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/Sources#sources) for your `<script>` tags.

You cannot pass through attributes such as `async`, `defer`, `src`, `type`, `noModule` because they are managed by React Router internally.

}
```

## Props

### context

[modes: framework, data, declarative]

Provides a context value to the element tree below the outlet. Use when the parent route needs to provide values to child routes.

```tsx
<Outlet context={myContextValue} />
```

Access the context with [useOutletContext](../hooks/useOutletContext).

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.Navigate.html)

A component-based version of [useNavigate](../hooks/useNavigate) to use in a [`React.Component
Class`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html) where hooks are not
able to be used.

It's recommended to avoid using this component in favor of [useNavigate](../hooks/useNavigate)

```tsx
<Navigate to="/tasks" />
```

# unstable_usePrompt

[MODES: framework, data]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.unstable_usePrompt.html)

Wrapper around useBlocker to show a window.confirm prompt to users instead of building a custom UI with [useBlocker](../hooks/useBlocker).

The `unstable_` flag will not be removed because this technique has a lot of rough edges and behaves very differently (and incorrectly sometimes) across browsers if users click addition back/forward navigations while the confirmation is open. Use at your own risk.

```tsx
function ImportantForm() {
  let [value, setValue] = React.useState("");

  // Block navigating elsewhere when data has been entered into the input
  unstable_usePrompt({
    message: "Are you sure?",
    when: ({ currentLocation, nextLocation }) =>
      value !== "" &&
      currentLocation.pathname !== nextLocation.pathname,
  });

  return (
    <Form method="post">
      <label>
        Enter some important data:
        <input
          name="data"
          value={value}
          onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
      <button type="submit">Save</button>
    </Form>
  );
}

title: useFetcher
---

# useFetcher

[MODES: framework, data]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.useFetcher.html)

Useful for creating complex, dynamic user interfaces that require multiple, concurrent data interactions without causing a navigation.

Fetchers track their own, independent state and can be used to load data, submit forms, and generally interact with loaders and actions.

```tsx
import { useFetcher } from "react-router"

function SomeComponent() {
  let fetcher = useFetcher()

  // states are available on the fetcher
  fetcher.state // "idle" | "loading" | "submitting"
  fetcher.data // the data returned from the action or loader

  // render a form
  <fetcher.Form method="post" />

  // load data
  fetcher.load("/some/route")

  // submit data
  fetcher.submit(someFormRef, { method: "post" })
  fetcher.submit(someData, {
    method: "post",
    encType: "application/json"
  })
}
```

## Signature

```tsx
useFetcher(options): FetcherWithComponents
```

# useRouteLoaderData

[MODES: framework, data]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.useRouteLoaderData.html)

Returns the loader data for a given route by route ID.

```tsx
import { useRouteLoaderData } from "react-router";

function SomeComponent() {
  const { user } = useRouteLoaderData("root");
}
```

Route IDs are created automatically. They are simply the path of the route file relative to the app folder without the extension.

| Route Filename               | Route ID               |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `app/root.tsx`               | `"root"`               |
| `app/routes/teams.tsx`       | `"routes/teams"`       |
| `app/whatever/teams.$id.tsx` | `"whatever/teams.$id"` |

If you created an ID manually, you can use that instead:

```tsx
route("/", "containers/app.tsx", { id: "app" }})
```

## Signature

```tsx
useRouteLoaderData(routeId): undefined
```

## Params

# useHref

[MODES: framework, data, declarative]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.useHref.html)

Resolves a URL against the current location.

```tsx
import { useHref } from "react-router";

function SomeComponent() {
  let href = useHref("some/where");
  // "/resolved/some/where"
}
```

# useNavigate

[MODES: framework, data, declarative]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.useNavigate.html)

Returns a function that lets you navigate programmatically in the browser in response to user interactions or effects.

```tsx
import { useNavigate } from "react-router";

function SomeComponent() {
  let navigate = useNavigate();
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        navigate(-1);
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

It's often better to use [redirect](../Utils/redirect) in [ActionFunction](../Other/ActionFunction) and [LoaderFunction](../Other/LoaderFunction) than this hook.

## Signature

```tsx
useNavigate(): NavigateFunction
```
---
title: useRevalidator
---

# useRevalidator

[MODES: framework, data]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.useRevalidator.html)

Revalidate the data on the page for reasons outside of normal data mutations like window focus or polling on an interval.

```tsx
import { useRevalidator } from "react-router";

function WindowFocusRevalidator() {
  const revalidator = useRevalidator();

  useFakeWindowFocus(() => {
    revalidator.revalidate();
  });

  return (
    <div hidden={revalidator.state === "idle"}>
      Revalidating...
    </div>
  );
}
```

Note that page data is already revalidated automatically after actions. If you find yourself using this for normal CRUD operations on your data in response to user interactions, you're probably not taking advantage of the other APIs like [useFetcher](../hooks/useFetcher), [Form](../components/Form), [useSubmit](../hooks/useSubmit) that do this automatically.

## Signature

```tsx
useRevalidator(): undefined
```
---
title: useSubmit
---

# useSubmit

[MODES: framework, data]

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.useSubmit.html)

The imperative version of [Form](../components/Form) that lets you submit a form from code instead of a user interaction.

```tsx
import { useSubmit } from "react-router";

function SomeComponent() {
  const submit = useSubmit();
  return (
    <Form
      onChange={(event) => {
        submit(event.currentTarget);
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Signature

```tsx
useSubmit(): SubmitFunction
```

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.useParams.html)

Returns an object of key/value pairs of the dynamic params from the current URL that were matched by the routes. Child routes inherit all params from their parent routes.

```tsx
import { useParams } from "react-router"

function SomeComponent() {
  let params = useParams()
  params.postId
}
```

Assuming a route pattern like `/posts/:postId` is matched by `/posts/123` then `params.postId` will be `"123"`.



## Signature

```tsx
useParams(): Readonly
```

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.useNavigation.html)

Returns the current navigation, defaulting to an "idle" navigation when no navigation is in progress. You can use this to render pending UI (like a global spinner) or read FormData from a form navigation.

```tsx
import { useNavigation } from "react-router";

function SomeComponent() {
  let navigation = useNavigation();
  navigation.state;
  navigation.formData;
  // etc.
}
```

## Summary

[Reference Documentation ↗](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.useRoutes.html)

Hook version of [Routes](../components/Routes) that uses objects instead of components. These objects have the same properties as the component props.

The return value of `useRoutes` is either a valid React element you can use to render the route tree, or `null` if nothing matched.

# Address Book

We'll be building a small, but feature-rich address book app that lets you keep track of your contacts. There's no database or other "production ready" things, so we can stay focused on the features React Router gives you. We expect it to take 30-45m if you're following along, otherwise it's a quick read.

<docs-info>

You can also watch our [walkthrough of the React Router Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw8FAg07kdo) if you prefer 🎥

</docs-info>

<img class="tutorial" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/01.webp" />

👉 **Every time you see this it means you need to do something in the app!**

The rest is just there for your information and deeper understanding. Let's get to it.

## Setup

👉 **Generate a basic template**

```shellscript nonumber
npx create-react-router@latest --template remix-run/react-router/tutorials/address-book
```

This uses a pretty bare-bones template but includes our css and data model, so we can focus on React Router.

👉 **Start the app**

```shellscript nonumber
# cd into the app directory
cd {wherever you put the app}

# install dependencies if you haven't already
npm install

# start the server
npm run dev
```

You should be able to open up [http://localhost:5173][http-localhost-5173] and see an unstyled screen that looks like this:

## The Root Route

Note the file at `app/root.tsx`. This is what we call the ["Root Route"][root-route]. It's the first component in the UI that renders, so it typically contains the global layout for the page, as well as a the default [Error Boundary][error-boundaries].

          </ul>
        </nav>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

export function Layout({

  let stack: string | undefined;

      {stack && (
        <pre>
          <code>{stack}</code>
        </pre>
      )}
    </main>
  );
}
```

</details>

## The Contact Route UI

If you click on one of the sidebar items you'll get the default 404 page. Let's create a route that matches the url `/contacts/1`.

👉 **Create a contact route module**

```shellscript nonumber
mkdir app/routes
touch app/routes/contact.tsx
```

We could put this file anywhere we want, but to make things a bit more organized, we'll put all our routes inside the `app/routes` directory.

You can also use [file-based routing if you prefer][file-route-conventions].

👉 **Configure the route**

We need to tell React Router about our new route. `routes.ts` is a special file where we can configure all our routes.

```tsx filename=routes.ts lines=[2,5]
import type { RouteConfig } from "@react-router/dev/routes";
import { route } from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
  route("contacts/:contactId", "routes/contact.tsx"),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

In React Router, `:` makes a segment dynamic. We just made the following urls match the `routes/contact.tsx` route module:

- `/contacts/123`
- `/contacts/abc`

👉 **Add the contact component UI**

It's just a bunch of elements, feel free to copy/paste.

```tsx filename=app/routes/contact.tsx
import { Form } from "react-router";

import type { ContactRecord } from "../data";

export default function Contact() {
  const contact = {
    first: "Your",
    last: "Name",
    avatar: "https://placecats.com/200/200",
    twitter: "your_handle",
    notes: "Some notes",
    favorite: true,
  };

  return (
    <div id="contact">
      <div>
        <img
          alt={`${contact.first} ${contact.last} avatar`}
          key={contact.avatar}
          src={contact.avatar}
        />
      </div>

      <div>
        <h1>
          {contact.first || contact.last ? (
            <>
              {contact.first} {contact.last}
            </>
          ) : (
            <i>No Name</i>
          )}
          <Favorite contact={contact} />
        </h1>

        {contact.twitter ? (
          <p>
            <a
              href={`https://twitter.com/${contact.twitter}`}
            >
              {contact.twitter}
            </a>
          </p>
        ) : null}

        {contact.notes ? <p>{contact.notes}</p> : null}

        <div>
          <Form action="edit">
            <button type="submit">Edit</button>
          </Form>

          <Form
            action="destroy"
            method="post"
            onSubmit={(event) => {
              const response = confirm(
                "Please confirm you want to delete this record."
              );
              if (!response) {
                event.preventDefault();
              }
            }}
          >
            <button type="submit">Delete</button>
          </Form>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

function Favorite({
  contact,
}: {
  contact: Pick<ContactRecord, "favorite">;
}) {
  const favorite = contact.favorite;

  return (
    <Form method="post">
      <button
        aria-label={
          favorite
            ? "Remove from favorites"
            : "Add to favorites"
        }
        name="favorite"
        value={favorite ? "false" : "true"}
      >
        {favorite ? "★" : "☆"}
      </button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

Now if we click one of the links or visit [`/contacts/1`][contacts-1] we get ... nothing new?

<img class="tutorial" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/02.webp" />

## Nested Routes and Outlets

React Router supports nested routing. In order for child routes to render inside of parent layouts, we need to render an [`Outlet`][outlet-component] in the parent. Let's fix it, open up `app/root.tsx` and render an outlet inside.

👉 **Render an [`<Outlet />`][outlet-component]**

```tsx filename=app/root.tsx lines=[3,15-17]
import {
  Form,
  Outlet,
  Scripts,
  ScrollRestoration,
  isRouteErrorResponse,
} from "react-router";

// existing imports & exports

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <div id="sidebar">{/* other elements */}</div>
      <div id="detail">
        <Outlet />
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

Now the child route should be rendering through the outlet.

<img class="tutorial" loading="lazy" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/03.webp" />

## Client Side Routing

You may or may not have noticed, but when we click the links in the sidebar, the browser is doing a full document request for the next URL instead of client side routing, which completely remounts our app

Client side routing allows our app to update the URL without reloading the entire page. Instead, the app can immediately render new UI. Let's make it happen with [`<Link>`][link-component].

👉 **Change the sidebar `<a href>` to `<Link to>`**

```tsx filename=app/root.tsx lines=[3,20,23]
import {
  Form,
  Link,
  Outlet,
  Scripts,
  ScrollRestoration,
  isRouteErrorResponse,
} from "react-router";

// existing imports & exports

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <div id="sidebar">
        {/* other elements */}
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Link to={`/contacts/1`}>Your Name</Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link to={`/contacts/2`}>Your Friend</Link>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </nav>
      </div>
      {/* other elements */}
    </>
  );
}
```

You can open the network tab in the browser devtools to see that it's not requesting documents anymore.

## Loading Data

URL segments, layouts, and data are more often than not coupled (tripled?) together. We can see it in this app already:

| URL Segment         | Component   | Data               |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| /                   | `<App>`     | list of contacts   |
| contacts/:contactId | `<Contact>` | individual contact |

Because of this natural coupling, React Router has data conventions to get data into your route components easily.

First we'll create and export a [`clientLoader`][client-loader] function in the root route and then render the data.

👉 **Export a `clientLoader` function from `app/root.tsx` and render the data**

<docs-info>The following code has a type error in it, we'll fix it in the next section</docs-info>

```tsx filename=app/root.tsx lines=[2,6-9,11-12,19-42]
// existing imports
import { getContacts } from "./data";

// existing exports

export async function clientLoader() {
  const contacts = await getContacts();
  return { contacts };
}

export default function App({ loaderData }) {
  const { contacts } = loaderData;

  return (
    <>
      <div id="sidebar">
        {/* other elements */}
        <nav>
          {contacts.length ? (
            <ul>
              {contacts.map((contact) => (
                <li key={contact.id}>
                  <Link to={`contacts/${contact.id}`}>
                    {contact.first || contact.last ? (
                      <>
                        {contact.first} {contact.last}
                      </>
                    ) : (
                      <i>No Name</i>
                    )}
                    {contact.favorite ? (
                      <span>★</span>
                    ) : null}
                  </Link>
                </li>
              ))}
            </ul>
          ) : (
            <p>
              <i>No contacts</i>
            </p>
          )}
        </nav>
      </div>
      {/* other elements */}
    </>
  );
}
```

That's it! React Router will now automatically keep that data in sync with your UI. The sidebar should now look like this:

<img class="tutorial" loading="lazy" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/04.webp" />

You may be wondering why we're "client" loading data instead of loading the data on the server so we can do server-side rendering (SSR). Right now our contacts site is a [Single Page App][spa], so there's no server-side rendering. This makes it really easy to deploy to any static hosting provider, but we'll talk more about how to enable SSR in a bit so you can learn about all the different [rendering strategies][rendering-strategies] React Router offers.

## Type Safety

You probably noticed that we didn't assign a type to the `loaderData` prop. Let's fix that.

👉 **Add the `ComponentProps` type to the `App` component**

```tsx filename=app/root.tsx lines=[5-7]
// existing imports
import type { Route } from "./+types/root";
// existing imports & exports

export default function App({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  const { contacts } = loaderData;

  // existing code
}
```

Wait, what? Where did these types come from?!

We didn't define them, yet somehow they already know about the `contacts` property we returned from our `clientLoader`.

That's because React Router [generates types for each route in your app][type-safety] to provide automatic type safety.

## Adding a `HydrateFallback`

We mentioned earlier that we are working on a [Single Page App][spa] with no server-side rendering. If you look inside of [`react-router.config.ts`][react-router-config] you'll see that this is configured with a simple boolean:

```tsx filename=react-router.config.ts lines=[4]
import { type Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";

export default {
  ssr: false,
} satisfies Config;
```

You might have started noticing that whenever you refresh the page you get a flash of white before the app loads. Since we're only rendering on the client, there's nothing to show the user while the app is loading.

👉 **Add a `HydrateFallback` export**

We can provide a fallback that will show up before the app is hydrated (rendering on the client for the first time) with a [`HydrateFallback`][hydrate-fallback] export.

```tsx filename=app/root.tsx lines=[3-10]
// existing imports & exports

export function HydrateFallback() {
  return (
    <div id="loading-splash">
      <div id="loading-splash-spinner" />
      <p>Loading, please wait...</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now if you refresh the page, you'll briefly see the loading splash before the app is hydrated.

<img class="tutorial" loading="lazy" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/05.webp" />

## Index Routes

When you load the app and aren't yet on a contact page, you'll notice a big blank page on the right side of the list.

<img class="tutorial" loading="lazy" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/06.webp" />

When a route has children, and you're at the parent route's path, the `<Outlet>` has nothing to render because no children match. You can think of [index routes][index-route] as the default child route to fill in that space.

👉 **Create an index route for the root route**

```shellscript nonumber
touch app/routes/home.tsx
```

```ts filename=app/routes.ts lines=[2,5]
import type { RouteConfig } from "@react-router/dev/routes";
import { index, route } from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
  index("routes/home.tsx"),
  route("contacts/:contactId", "routes/contact.tsx"),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

👉 **Fill in the index component's elements**

Feel free to copy/paste, nothing special here.

```tsx filename=app/routes/home.tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <p id="index-page">
      This is a demo for React Router.
      <br />
      Check out{" "}
      <a href="https://reactrouter.com">
        the docs at reactrouter.com
      </a>
      .
    </p>
  );
}
```

<img class="tutorial" loading="lazy" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/07.webp" />

Voilà! No more blank space. It's common to put dashboards, stats, feeds, etc. at index routes. They can participate in data loading as well.

## Adding an About Route

Before we move on to working with dynamic data that the user can interact with, let's add a page with static content we expect to rarely change. An about page will be perfect for this.

👉 **Create the about route**

```shellscript nonumber
touch app/routes/about.tsx
```

Don't forget to add the route to `app/routes.ts`:

```tsx filename=app/routes.ts lines=[4]
export default [
  index("routes/home.tsx"),
  route("contacts/:contactId", "routes/contact.tsx"),
  route("about", "routes/about.tsx"),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

👉 **Add the about page UI**

Nothing too special here, just copy and paste:

```tsx filename=app/routes/about.tsx
import { Link } from "react-router";

export default function About() {
  return (
    <div id="about">
      <Link to="/">← Go to demo</Link>
      <h1>About React Router Contacts</h1>

      <div>

          applications with React Router.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

👉 **Add a link to the about page in the sidebar**

```tsx filename=app/root.tsx lines=[5-7]
export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <div id="sidebar">
        <h1>
          <Link to="about">React Router Contacts</Link>
        </h1>
        {/* other elements */}
      </div>
      {/* other elements */}
    </>
  );
}
```

Now navigate to the [about page][about-page] and it should look like this:

<img class="tutorial" loading="lazy" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/08.webp" />

## Layout Routes

We don't actually want the about page to be nested inside of the sidebar layout. Let's move the sidebar to a layout so we can avoid rendering it on the about page. Additionally, we want to avoid loading all the contacts data on the about page.

👉 **Create a layout route for the sidebar**

You can name and put this layout route wherever you want, but putting it inside of a `layouts` directory will help keep things organized for our simple app.

```shellscript nonumber
mkdir app/layouts
touch app/layouts/sidebar.tsx
```

For now just return an [`<Outlet>`][outlet-component].

```tsx filename=app/layouts/sidebar.tsx
import { Outlet } from "react-router";

export default function SidebarLayout() {
  return <Outlet />;
}
```

👉 **Move route definitions under the sidebar layout**

We can define a `layout` route to automatically render the sidebar for all matched routes within in. This is basically what our `root` was, but now we can scope it to specific routes.

```ts filename=app/routes.ts lines=[4,9,12]
import type { RouteConfig } from "@react-router/dev/routes";
import {
  index,
  layout,
  route,
} from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
  layout("layouts/sidebar.tsx", [
    index("routes/home.tsx"),
    route("contacts/:contactId", "routes/contact.tsx"),
  ]),
  route("about", "routes/about.tsx"),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

👉 **Move the layout and data fetching to the sidebar layout**

We want to move the `clientLoader` and everything inside the `App` component to the sidebar layout. It should look like this:

```tsx filename=app/layouts/sidebar.tsx
import { Form, Link, Outlet } from "react-router";
import { getContacts } from "../data";
import type { Route } from "./+types/sidebar";

export async function clientLoader() {
  const contacts = await getContacts();
  return { contacts };
}

export default function SidebarLayout({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  const { contacts } = loaderData;

  return (
    <>
      <div id="sidebar">
        <h1>
          <Link to="about">React Router Contacts</Link>
        </h1>
        <div>
          <Form id="search-form" role="search">
            <input
              aria-label="Search contacts"
              id="q"
              name="q"
              placeholder="Search"
              type="search"
            />
            <div
              aria-hidden
              hidden={true}
              id="search-spinner"
            />
          </Form>
          <Form method="post">
            <button type="submit">New</button>
          </Form>
        </div>
        <nav>
          {contacts.length ? (
            <ul>
              {contacts.map((contact) => (
                <li key={contact.id}>
                  <Link to={`contacts/${contact.id}`}>
                    {contact.first || contact.last ? (
                      <>
                        {contact.first} {contact.last}
                      </>
                    ) : (
                      <i>No Name</i>
                    )}
                    {contact.favorite ? (
                      <span>★</span>
                    ) : null}
                  </Link>
                </li>
              ))}
            </ul>
          ) : (
            <p>
              <i>No contacts</i>
            </p>
          )}
        </nav>
      </div>
      <div id="detail">
        <Outlet />
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

And inside `app/root.tsx`, `App` should just return an [`<Outlet>`][outlet-component], and all unused imports can be removed. Make sure there is no `clientLoader` in `root.tsx`.

```tsx filename=app/root.tsx lines=[3-10]
// existing imports and exports

export default function App() {
  return <Outlet />;
}
```

Now with that shuffling around done, our about page no longer loads contacts data nor is it nested inside of the sidebar layout:

<img class="tutorial" loading="lazy" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/09.webp" />

## Pre-rendering a Static Route

If you refresh the about page, you still see the loading spinner for just a split second before the page render on the client. This is really not a good experience, plus the page is just static information, we should be able to pre-render it as static HTML at build time.

👉 **Pre-render the about page**

Inside of `react-router.config.ts`, we can add a [`prerender`][pre-rendering] array to the config to tell React Router to pre-render certain urls at build time. In this case we just want to pre-render the about page.

```ts filename=app/react-router.config.ts lines=[5]
import { type Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";

export default {
  ssr: false,
  prerender: ["/about"],
} satisfies Config;
```

Now if you go to the [about page][about-page] and refresh, you won't see the loading spinner!

<docs-warning>

If you're still seeing a spinner when you refresh, make sure you deleted the `clientLoader` in `root.tsx`.

</docs-warning>

## Server-Side Rendering

React Router is a great framework for building [Single Page Apps][spa]. Many applications are served well by only client-side rendering, and _maybe_ statically pre-rendering a few pages at build time.

If you ever do want to introduce server-side rendering into your React Router application, it's incredibly easy (remember that `ssr: false` boolean from earlier?).

👉 **Enable server-side rendering**

```ts filename=app/react-router.config.ts lines=[2]
export default {
  ssr: true,
  prerender: ["/about"],
} satisfies Config;
```

And now... nothing is different? We're still getting our spinner for a split second before the page renders on the client? Plus, aren't we using `clientLoader`, so our data is still being fetched on the client?

That's right! With React Router you can still use `clientLoader` (and `clientAction`) to do client-side data fetching where you see fit. React Router gives you a lot of flexibility to use the right tool for the job.

Let's switch to using [`loader`][loader], which (you guessed it) is used to fetch data on the server.

👉 **Switch to using `loader` to fetch data**

```tsx filename=app/layouts/sidebar.tsx lines=[3]
// existing imports

export async function loader() {
  const contacts = await getContacts();
  return { contacts };
}
```

Whether you set `ssr` to `true` or `false` depends on you and your users needs. Both strategies are perfectly valid. For the remainder of this tutorial we're going to use server-side rendering, but know that all rendering strategies are first class citizens in React Router.

## URL Params in Loaders

👉 **Click on one of the sidebar links**

We should be seeing our old static contact page again, with one difference: the URL now has a real ID for the record.

<img class="tutorial" loading="lazy" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/10.webp" />

Remember the `:contactId` part of the route definition in `app/routes.ts`? These dynamic segments will match dynamic (changing) values in that position of the URL. We call these values in the URL "URL Params", or just "params" for short.

These `params` are passed to the loader with keys that match the dynamic segment. For example, our segment is named `:contactId` so the value will be passed as `params.contactId`.

These params are most often used to find a record by ID. Let's try it out.

👉 **Add a `loader` function to the contact page and access data with `loaderData`**

<docs-info>The following code has type errors in it, we'll fix them in the next section</docs-info>

```tsx filename=app/routes/contact.tsx lines=[2-3,5-8,10-13]
// existing imports
import { getContact } from "../data";
import type { Route } from "./+types/contact";

export async function loader({ params }: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const contact = await getContact(params.contactId);
  return { contact };
}

export default function Contact({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  const { contact } = loaderData;

  // existing code
}

// existing code
```

<img class="tutorial" loading="lazy" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/11.webp" />

## Throwing Responses

You'll notice that the type of `loaderData.contact` is `ContactRecord | null`. Based on our automatic type safety, TypeScript already knows that `params.contactId` is a string, but we haven't done anything to make sure it's a valid ID. Since the contact might not exist, `getContact` could return `null`, which is why we have type errors.

We could account for the possibility of the contact being not found in component code, but the webby thing to do is send a proper 404. We can do that in the loader and solve all of our problems at once.

```tsx filename=app/routes/contact.tsx lines=[5-7]
// existing imports

export async function loader({ params }: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const contact = await getContact(params.contactId);
  if (!contact) {
    throw new Response("Not Found", { status: 404 });
  }
  return { contact };
}

// existing code
```

Now, if the user isn't found, code execution down this path stops and React Router renders the error path instead. Components in React Router can focus only on the happy path 😁

## Data Mutations

We'll create our first contact in a second, but first let's talk about HTML.

React Router emulates HTML Form navigation as the data mutation primitive, which used to be the only way prior to the JavaScript cambrian explosion. Don't be fooled by the simplicity! Forms in React Router give you the UX capabilities of client rendered apps with the simplicity of the "old school" web model.

While unfamiliar to some web developers, HTML `form`s actually cause a navigation in the browser, just like clicking a link. The only difference is in the request: links can only change the URL while `form`s can also change the request method (`GET` vs. `POST`) and the request body (`POST` form data).

Without client side routing, the browser will serialize the `form`'s data automatically and send it to the server as the request body for `POST`, and as [`URLSearchParams`][url-search-params] for `GET`. React Router does the same thing, except instead of sending the request to the server, it uses client side routing and sends it to the route's [`action`][action] function.

We can test this out by clicking the "New" button in our app.

<img class="tutorial" loading="lazy" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/12.webp" />

React Router sends a 405 because there is no code on the server to handle this form navigation.

## Creating Contacts

We'll create new contacts by exporting an `action` function in our root route. When the user clicks the "new" button, the form will `POST` to the root route action.

👉 **Export an `action` function from `app/root.tsx`**

```tsx filename=app/root.tsx lines=[3,5-8]
// existing imports

import { createEmptyContact } from "./data";

export async function action() {
  const contact = await createEmptyContact();
  return { contact };
}

// existing code
```

That's it! Go ahead and click the "New" button, and you should see a new record pop into the list 🥳

<img class="tutorial" loading="lazy" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/13.webp" />

The `createEmptyContact` method just creates an empty contact with no name or data or anything. But it does still create a record, promise!

> 🧐 Wait a sec ... How did the sidebar update? Where did we call the `action` function? Where's the code to re-fetch the data? Where are `useState`, `onSubmit` and `useEffect`?!

This is where the "old school web" programming model shows up. [`<Form>`][form-component] prevents the browser from sending the request to the server and sends it to your route's `action` function instead with [`fetch`][fetch].

In web semantics, a `POST` usually means some data is changing. By convention, React Router uses this as a hint to automatically revalidate the data on the page after the `action` finishes.

In fact, since it's all just HTML and HTTP, you could disable JavaScript and the whole thing will still work. Instead of React Router serializing the form and making a [`fetch`][fetch] request to your server, the browser will serialize the form and make a document request. From there React Router will render the page server side and send it down. It's the same UI in the end either way.

We'll keep JavaScript around though because we're going to make a better user experience than spinning favicons and static documents.

## Updating Data

Let's add a way to fill the information for our new record.

Just like creating data, you update data with [`<Form>`][form-component]. Let's make a new route module inside `app/routes/edit-contact.tsx`.

👉 **Create the edit contact route**

```shellscript nonumber
touch app/routes/edit-contact.tsx
```

Don't forget to add the route to `app/routes.ts`:

```tsx filename=app/routes.ts lines=[5-8]
export default [
  layout("layouts/sidebar.tsx", [
    index("routes/home.tsx"),
    route("contacts/:contactId", "routes/contact.tsx"),
    route(
      "contacts/:contactId/edit",
      "routes/edit-contact.tsx"
    ),
  ]),
  route("about", "routes/about.tsx"),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

👉 **Add the edit page UI**

Nothing we haven't seen before, feel free to copy/paste:

```tsx filename=app/routes/edit-contact.tsx
import { Form } from "react-router";
import type { Route } from "./+types/edit-contact";

import { getContact } from "../data";

export async function loader({ params }: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const contact = await getContact(params.contactId);
  if (!contact) {
    throw new Response("Not Found", { status: 404 });
  }
  return { contact };
}

export default function EditContact({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  const { contact } = loaderData;

  return (
    <Form key={contact.id} id="contact-form" method="post">
      <p>
        <span>Name</span>
        <input
          aria-label="First name"
          defaultValue={contact.first}
          name="first"
          placeholder="First"
          type="text"
        />
        <input
          aria-label="Last name"
          defaultValue={contact.last}
          name="last"
          placeholder="Last"
          type="text"
        />
      </p>
      <label>
        <span>Twitter</span>
        <input
          defaultValue={contact.twitter}
          name="twitter"
          placeholder="@jack"
          type="text"
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        <span>Avatar URL</span>
        <input
          aria-label="Avatar URL"
          defaultValue={contact.avatar}
          name="avatar"
          placeholder="https://example.com/avatar.jpg"
          type="text"
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        <span>Notes</span>
        <textarea
          defaultValue={contact.notes}
          name="notes"
          rows={6}
        />
      </label>
      <p>
        <button type="submit">Save</button>
        <button type="button">Cancel</button>
      </p>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

Now click on your new record, then click the "Edit" button. We should see the new route.

<img class="tutorial" loading="lazy" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/14.webp" />

## Updating Contacts with `FormData`

The edit route we just created already renders a `form`. All we need to do is add the `action` function. React Router will serialize the `form`, `POST` it with [`fetch`][fetch], and automatically revalidate all the data.

👉 **Add an `action` function to the edit route**

```tsx filename=app/routes/edit-contact.tsx lines=[1,4,8,6-15]
import { Form, redirect } from "react-router";
// existing imports

import { getContact, updateContact } from "../data";

export async function action({
  params,
  request,
}: Route.ActionArgs) {
  const formData = await request.formData();
  const updates = Object.fromEntries(formData);
  await updateContact(params.contactId, updates);
  return redirect(`/contacts/${params.contactId}`);
}

// existing code
```

Fill out the form, hit save, and you should see something like this! <small>(Except easier on the eyes and maybe with the patience to cut watermelon.)</small>

<img class="tutorial" loading="lazy" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/15.webp" />

## Mutation Discussion

> 😑 It worked, but I have no idea what is going on here...

Let's dig in a bit...

Open up `app/routes/edit-contact.tsx` and look at the `form` elements. Notice how they each have a name:

```tsx filename=app/routes/edit-contact.tsx lines=[4]
<input
  aria-label="First name"
  defaultValue={contact.first}
  name="first"
  placeholder="First"
  type="text"
/>
```

Without JavaScript, when a form is submitted, the browser will create [`FormData`][form-data] and set it as the body of the request when it sends it to the server. As mentioned before, React Router prevents that and emulates the browser by sending the request to your `action` function with [`fetch`][fetch] instead, including the [`FormData`][form-data].

Each field in the `form` is accessible with `formData.get(name)`. For example, given the input field from above, you could access the first and last names like this:

```tsx filename=app/routes/edit-contact.tsx  lines=[6,7] nocopy
export const action = async ({
  params,
  request,
}: ActionFunctionArgs) => {
  const formData = await request.formData();
  const firstName = formData.get("first");
  const lastName = formData.get("last");
  // ...
};
```

Since we have a handful of form fields, we used [`Object.fromEntries`][object-from-entries] to collect them all into an object, which is exactly what our `updateContact` function wants.

```tsx filename=app/routes/edit-contact.tsx nocopy
const updates = Object.fromEntries(formData);
updates.first; // "Some"
updates.last; // "Name"
```

Aside from the `action` function, none of these APIs we're discussing are provided by React Router: [`request`][request], [`request.formData`][request-form-data], [`Object.fromEntries`][object-from-entries] are all provided by the web platform.

After we finished the `action`, note the [`redirect`][redirect] at the end:

```tsx filename=app/routes/edit-contact.tsx lines=[9]
export async function action({
  params,
  request,
}: Route.ActionArgs) {
  invariant(params.contactId, "Missing contactId param");
  const formData = await request.formData();
  const updates = Object.fromEntries(formData);
  await updateContact(params.contactId, updates);
  return redirect(`/contacts/${params.contactId}`);
}
```

`action` and `loader` functions can both return a `Response` (makes sense, since they received a [`Request`][request]!). The [`redirect`][redirect] helper just makes it easier to return a [`Response`][response] that tells the app to change locations.

Without client side routing, if a server redirected after a `POST` request, the new page would fetch the latest data and render. As we learned before, React Router emulates this model and automatically revalidates the data on the page after the `action` call. That's why the sidebar automatically updates when we save the form. The extra revalidation code doesn't exist without client side routing, so it doesn't need to exist with client side routing in React Router either!

One last thing. Without JavaScript, the [`redirect`][redirect] would be a normal redirect. However, with JavaScript it's a client-side redirect, so the user doesn't lose client state like scroll positions or component state.

## Redirecting new records to the edit page

Now that we know how to redirect, let's update the action that creates new contacts to redirect to the edit page:

👉 **Redirect to the new record's edit page**

```tsx filename=app/root.tsx lines=[6,12]
import {
  Outlet,
  Scripts,
  ScrollRestoration,
  isRouteErrorResponse,
  redirect,
} from "react-router";
// existing imports

export async function action() {
  const contact = await createEmptyContact();
  return redirect(`/contacts/${contact.id}/edit`);
}

// existing code
```

Now when we click "New", we should end up on the edit page:

<img class="tutorial" loading="lazy" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/16.webp" />

## Active Link Styling

Now that we have a bunch of records, it's not clear which one we're looking at in the sidebar. We can use [`NavLink`][nav-link] to fix this.

👉 **Replace `<Link>` with `<NavLink>` in the sidebar**

```tsx filename=app/layouts/sidebar.tsx lines=[1,17-26,28]
import { Form, Link, NavLink, Outlet } from "react-router";

// existing imports and exports

export default function SidebarLayout({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  const { contacts } = loaderData;

  return (
    <>
      <div id="sidebar">
        {/* existing elements */}
        <ul>
          {contacts.map((contact) => (
            <li key={contact.id}>
              <NavLink
                className={({ isActive, isPending }) =>
                  isActive
                    ? "active"
                    : isPending
                    ? "pending"
                    : ""
                }
                to={`contacts/${contact.id}`}
              >
                {/* existing elements */}
              </NavLink>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
        {/* existing elements */}
      </div>
      {/* existing elements */}
    </>
  );
}
```

Note that we are passing a function to `className`. When the user is at the URL that matches `<NavLink to>`, then `isActive` will be true. When it's _about_ to be active (the data is still loading) then `isPending` will be true. This allows us to easily indicate where the user is and also provide immediate feedback when links are clicked but data needs to be loaded.

<img class="tutorial" loading="lazy" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/17.webp" />

## Global Pending UI

As the user navigates the app, React Router will _leave the old page up_ as data is loading for the next page. You may have noticed the app feels a little unresponsive as you click between the list. Let's provide the user with some feedback so the app doesn't feel unresponsive.

React Router is managing all the state behind the scenes and reveals the pieces you need to build dynamic web apps. In this case, we'll use the [`useNavigation`][use-navigation] hook.

👉 **Use `useNavigation` to add global pending UI**

```tsx filename=app/layouts/sidebar.tsx lines=[6,13,19-21]
import {
  Form,
  Link,
  NavLink,
  Outlet,
  useNavigation,
} from "react-router";

export default function SidebarLayout({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  const { contacts } = loaderData;
  const navigation = useNavigation();

  return (
    <>
      {/* existing elements */}
      <div
        className={
          navigation.state === "loading" ? "loading" : ""
        }
        id="detail"
      >
        <Outlet />
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

[`useNavigation`][use-navigation] returns the current navigation state: it can be one of `"idle"`, `"loading"` or `"submitting"`.

In our case, we add a `"loading"` class to the main part of the app if we're not idle. The CSS then adds a nice fade after a short delay (to avoid flickering the UI for fast loads). You could do anything you want though, like show a spinner or loading bar across the top.

<img class="tutorial" loading="lazy" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/18.webp" />

## Deleting Records

If we review code in the contact route, we can find the delete button looks like this:

```tsx filename=app/routes/contact.tsx lines=[2]
<Form
  action="destroy"
  method="post"
  onSubmit={(event) => {
    const response = confirm(
      "Please confirm you want to delete this record."
    );
    if (!response) {
      event.preventDefault();
    }
  }}
>
  <button type="submit">Delete</button>
</Form>
```

Note the `action` points to `"destroy"`. Like `<Link to>`, `<Form action>` can take a _relative_ value. Since the form is rendered in the route `contacts/:contactId`, then a relative action with `destroy` will submit the form to `contacts/:contactId/destroy` when clicked.

At this point you should know everything you need to know to make the delete button work. Maybe give it a shot before moving on? You'll need:

1. A new route
2. An `action` at that route
3. `deleteContact` from `app/data.ts`
4. `redirect` to somewhere after

👉 **Configure the "destroy" route module**

```shellscript nonumber
touch app/routes/destroy-contact.tsx
```

```tsx filename=app/routes.ts lines=[3-6]
export default [
  // existing routes
  route(
    "contacts/:contactId/destroy",
    "routes/destroy-contact.tsx"
  ),
  // existing routes
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

👉 **Add the destroy action**

```tsx filename=app/routes/destroy-contact.tsx
import { redirect } from "react-router";
import type { Route } from "./+types/destroy-contact";

import { deleteContact } from "../data";

export async function action({ params }: Route.ActionArgs) {
  await deleteContact(params.contactId);
  return redirect("/");
}
```

Alright, navigate to a record and click the "Delete" button. It works!

> 😅 I'm still confused why this all works

When the user clicks the submit button:

1. `<Form>` prevents the default browser behavior of sending a new document `POST` request to the server, but instead emulates the browser by creating a `POST` request with client side routing and [`fetch`][fetch]
2. The `<Form action="destroy">` matches the new route at `contacts/:contactId/destroy` and sends it the request
3. After the `action` redirects, React Router calls all the `loader`s for the data on the page to get the latest values (this is "revalidation"). `loaderData` in `routes/contact.tsx` now has new values and causes the components to update!

Add a `Form`, add an `action`, React Router does the rest.

## Cancel Button

On the edit page we've got a cancel button that doesn't do anything yet. We'd like it to do the same thing as the browser's back button.

We'll need a click handler on the button as well as [`useNavigate`][use-navigate].

👉 **Add the cancel button click handler with `useNavigate`**

```tsx filename=app/routes/edit-contact.tsx lines=[1,8,15]
import { Form, redirect, useNavigate } from "react-router";
// existing imports & exports

export default function EditContact({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  const { contact } = loaderData;
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  return (
    <Form key={contact.id} id="contact-form" method="post">
      {/* existing elements */}
      <p>
        <button type="submit">Save</button>
        <button onClick={() => navigate(-1)} type="button">
          Cancel
        </button>
      </p>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

Now when the user clicks "Cancel", they'll be sent back one entry in the browser's history.

> 🧐 Why is there no `event.preventDefault()` on the button?

A `<button type="button">`, while seemingly redundant, is the HTML way of preventing a button from submitting its form.

Two more features to go. We're on the home stretch!

## `URLSearchParams` and `GET` Submissions

All of our interactive UI so far have been either links that change the URL or `form`s that post data to `action` functions. The search field is interesting because it's a mix of both: it's a `form`, but it only changes the URL, it doesn't change data.

Let's see what happens when we submit the search form:

👉 **Type a name into the search field and hit the enter key**

Note the browser's URL now contains your query in the URL as [`URLSearchParams`][url-search-params]:

```
http://localhost:5173/?q=ryan
```

Since it's not `<Form method="post">`, React Router emulates the browser by serializing the [`FormData`][form-data] into the [`URLSearchParams`][url-search-params] instead of the request body.

`loader` functions have access to the search params from the `request`. Let's use it to filter the list:

👉 **Filter the list if there are `URLSearchParams`**

```tsx filename=app/layouts/sidebar.tsx lines=[3-8]
// existing imports & exports

export async function loader({
  request,
}: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const q = url.searchParams.get("q");
  const contacts = await getContacts(q);
  return { contacts };
}

// existing code
```

<img class="tutorial" loading="lazy" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/19.webp" />

Because this is a `GET`, not a `POST`, React Router _does not_ call the `action` function. Submitting a `GET` `form` is the same as clicking a link: only the URL changes.

This also means it's a normal page navigation. You can click the back button to get back to where you were.

## Synchronizing URLs to Form State

There are a couple of UX issues here that we can take care of quickly.

1. If you click back after a search, the form field still has the value you entered even though the list is no longer filtered.
2. If you refresh the page after searching, the form field no longer has the value in it, even though the list is filtered

In other words, the URL and our input's state are out of sync.

Let's solve (2) first and start the input with the value from the URL.

👉 **Return `q` from your `loader`, set it as the input's default value**

```tsx filename=app/layouts/sidebar.tsx lines=[9,15,26]
// existing imports & exports

export async function loader({
  request,
}: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const q = url.searchParams.get("q");
  const contacts = await getContacts(q);
  return { contacts, q };
}

export default function SidebarLayout({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  const { contacts, q } = loaderData;
  const navigation = useNavigation();

  return (
    <>
      <div id="sidebar">
        {/* existing elements */}
        <div>
          <Form id="search-form" role="search">
            <input
              aria-label="Search contacts"
              defaultValue={q || ""}
              id="q"
              name="q"
              placeholder="Search"
              type="search"
            />
            {/* existing elements */}
          </Form>
          {/* existing elements */}
        </div>
        {/* existing elements */}
      </div>
      {/* existing elements */}
    </>
  );
}
```

The input field will show the query if you refresh the page after a search now.

Now for problem (1), clicking the back button and updating the input. We can bring in `useEffect` from React to manipulate the input's value in the DOM directly.

👉 **Synchronize input value with the `URLSearchParams`**

```tsx filename=app/layouts/sidebar.tsx lines=[2,12-17]
// existing imports
import { useEffect } from "react";

// existing imports & exports

export default function SidebarLayout({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  const { contacts, q } = loaderData;
  const navigation = useNavigation();

  useEffect(() => {
    const searchField = document.getElementById("q");
    if (searchField instanceof HTMLInputElement) {
      searchField.value = q || "";
    }
  }, [q]);

  // existing code
}
```

> 🤔 Shouldn't you use a controlled component and React State for this?

You could certainly do this as a controlled component. You will have more synchronization points, but it's up to you.

<details>

<summary>Expand this to see what it would look like</summary>

```tsx filename=app/layouts/sidebar.tsx lines=[2,11-12,14-18,30-33,36-37]
// existing imports
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

// existing imports & exports

export default function SidebarLayout({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  const { contacts, q } = loaderData;
  const navigation = useNavigation();
  // the query now needs to be kept in state
  const [query, setQuery] = useState(q || "");

  // we still have a `useEffect` to synchronize the query
  // to the component state on back/forward button clicks
  useEffect(() => {
    setQuery(q || "");
  }, [q]);

  return (
    <>
      <div id="sidebar">
        {/* existing elements */}
        <div>
          <Form id="search-form" role="search">
            <input
              aria-label="Search contacts"
              id="q"
              name="q"
              // synchronize user's input to component state
              onChange={(event) =>
                setQuery(event.currentTarget.value)
              }
              placeholder="Search"
              type="search"
              // switched to `value` from `defaultValue`
              value={query}
            />
            {/* existing elements */}
          </Form>
          {/* existing elements */}
        </div>
        {/* existing elements */}
      </div>
      {/* existing elements */}
    </>
  );
}
```

</details>

Alright, you should now be able to click the back/forward/refresh buttons and the input's value should be in sync with the URL and results.

## Submitting `Form`'s `onChange`

We've got a product decision to make here. Sometimes you want the user to submit the `form` to filter some results, other times you want to filter as the user types. We've already implemented the first, so let's see what it's like for the second.

We've seen `useNavigate` already, we'll use its cousin, [`useSubmit`][use-submit], for this.

```tsx filename=app/layouts/sidebar.tsx lines=[7,16,27-29]
import {
  Form,
  Link,
  NavLink,
  Outlet,
  useNavigation,
  useSubmit,
} from "react-router";
// existing imports & exports

export default function SidebarLayout({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  const { contacts, q } = loaderData;
  const navigation = useNavigation();
  const submit = useSubmit();

  // existing code

  return (
    <>
      <div id="sidebar">
        {/* existing elements */}
        <div>
          <Form
            id="search-form"
            onChange={(event) =>
              submit(event.currentTarget)
            }
            role="search"
          >
            {/* existing elements */}
          </Form>
          {/* existing elements */}
        </div>
        {/* existing elements */}
      </div>
      {/* existing elements */}
    </>
  );
}
```

As you type, the `form` is automatically submitted now!

Note the argument to [`submit`][use-submit]. The `submit` function will serialize and submit any form you pass to it. We're passing in `event.currentTarget`. The `currentTarget` is the DOM node the event is attached to (the `form`).

## Adding Search Spinner

In a production app, it's likely this search will be looking for records in a database that is too large to send all at once and filter client side. That's why this demo has some faked network latency.

Without any loading indicator, the search feels kinda sluggish. Even if we could make our database faster, we'll always have the user's network latency in the way and out of our control.

For a better user experience, let's add some immediate UI feedback for the search. We'll use [`useNavigation`][use-navigation] again.

👉 **Add a variable to know if we're searching**

```tsx filename=app/layouts/sidebar.tsx lines=[9-13]
// existing imports & exports

export default function SidebarLayout({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  const { contacts, q } = loaderData;
  const navigation = useNavigation();
  const submit = useSubmit();
  const searching =
    navigation.location &&
    new URLSearchParams(navigation.location.search).has(
      "q"
    );

  // existing code
}
```

When nothing is happening, `navigation.location` will be `undefined`, but when the user navigates it will be populated with the next location while data loads. Then we check if they're searching with `location.search`.

👉 **Add classes to search form elements using the new `searching` state**

```tsx filename=app/layouts/sidebar.tsx lines=[22,31]
// existing imports & exports

export default function SidebarLayout({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  // existing code

  return (
    <>
      <div id="sidebar">
        {/* existing elements */}
        <div>
          <Form
            id="search-form"
            onChange={(event) =>
              submit(event.currentTarget)
            }
            role="search"
          >
            <input
              aria-label="Search contacts"
              className={searching ? "loading" : ""}
              defaultValue={q || ""}
              id="q"
              name="q"
              placeholder="Search"
              type="search"
            />
            <div
              aria-hidden
              hidden={!searching}
              id="search-spinner"
            />
          </Form>
          {/* existing elements */}
        </div>
        {/* existing elements */}
      </div>
      {/* existing elements */}
    </>
  );
}
```

Bonus points, avoid fading out the main screen when searching:

```tsx filename=app/layouts/sidebar.tsx lines=[13]
// existing imports & exports

export default function SidebarLayout({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  // existing code

  return (
    <>
      {/* existing elements */}
      <div
        className={
          navigation.state === "loading" && !searching
            ? "loading"
            : ""
        }
        id="detail"
      >
        <Outlet />
      </div>
      {/* existing elements */}
    </>
  );
}
```

You should now have a nice spinner on the left side of the search input.

<img class="tutorial" loading="lazy" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/20.webp" />

## Managing the History Stack

Since the form is submitted for every keystroke, typing the characters "alex" and then deleting them with backspace results in a huge history stack 😂. We definitely don't want this:

<img class="tutorial" loading="lazy" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/21.webp" />

We can avoid this by _replacing_ the current entry in the history stack with the next page, instead of pushing into it.

👉 **Use `replace` in `submit`**

```tsx filename=app/layouts/sidebar.tsx lines=[16-19]
// existing imports & exports

export default function SidebarLayout({
  loaderData,
}: Route.ComponentProps) {
  // existing code

  return (
    <>
      <div id="sidebar">
        {/* existing elements */}
        <div>
          <Form
            id="search-form"
            onChange={(event) => {
              const isFirstSearch = q === null;
              submit(event.currentTarget, {
                replace: !isFirstSearch,
              });
            }}
            role="search"
          >
            {/* existing elements */}
          </Form>
          {/* existing elements */}
        </div>
        {/* existing elements */}
      </div>
      {/* existing elements */}
    </>
  );
}
```

After a quick check if this is the first search or not, we decide to replace. Now the first search will add a new entry, but every keystroke after that will replace the current entry. Instead of clicking back 7 times to remove the search, users only have to click back once.

## `Form`s Without Navigation

So far all of our forms have changed the URL. While these user flows are common, it's equally common to want to submit a form _without_ causing a navigation.

For these cases, we have [`useFetcher`][use-fetcher]. It allows us to communicate with `action`s and `loader`s without causing a navigation.

The ★ button on the contact page makes sense for this. We aren't creating or deleting a new record, and we don't want to change pages. We simply want to change the data on the page we're looking at.

👉 **Change the `<Favorite>` form to a fetcher form**

```tsx filename=app/routes/contact.tsx lines=[1,10,14,26]
import { Form, useFetcher } from "react-router";

// existing imports & exports

function Favorite({
  contact,
}: {
  contact: Pick<ContactRecord, "favorite">;
}) {
  const fetcher = useFetcher();
  const favorite = contact.favorite;

  return (
    <fetcher.Form method="post">
      <button
        aria-label={
          favorite
            ? "Remove from favorites"
            : "Add to favorites"
        }
        name="favorite"
        value={favorite ? "false" : "true"}
      >
        {favorite ? "★" : "☆"}
      </button>
    </fetcher.Form>
  );
}
```

This form will no longer cause a navigation, but simply fetch to the `action`. Speaking of which ... this won't work until we create the `action`.

👉 **Create the `action`**

```tsx filename=app/routes/contact.tsx lines=[2,5-13]
// existing imports
import { getContact, updateContact } from "../data";
// existing imports

export async function action({
  params,
  request,
}: Route.ActionArgs) {
  const formData = await request.formData();
  return updateContact(params.contactId, {
    favorite: formData.get("favorite") === "true",
  });
}

// existing code
```

Alright, we're ready to click the star next to the user's name!

<img class="tutorial" loading="lazy" src="/_docs/v7_address_book_tutorial/22.webp" />

Check that out, both stars automatically update. Our new `<fetcher.Form method="post">` works almost exactly like the `<Form>` we've been using: it calls the action and then all data is revalidated automatically — even your errors will be caught the same way.

There is one key difference though, it's not a navigation, so the URL doesn't change and the history stack is unaffected.

## Optimistic UI

You probably noticed the app felt kind of unresponsive when we clicked the favorite button from the last section. Once again, we added some network latency because you're going to have it in the real world.

To give the user some feedback, we could put the star into a loading state with `fetcher.state` (a lot like `navigation.state` from before), but we can do something even better this time. We can use a strategy called "Optimistic UI".

The fetcher knows the [`FormData`][form-data] being submitted to the `action`, so it's available to you on `fetcher.formData`. We'll use that to immediately update the star's state, even though the network hasn't finished. If the update eventually fails, the UI will revert to the real data.

👉 **Read the optimistic value from `fetcher.formData`**

```tsx filename=app/routes/contact.tsx lines=[9-11]
// existing code

function Favorite({
  contact,
}: {
  contact: Pick<ContactRecord, "favorite">;
}) {
  const fetcher = useFetcher();
  const favorite = fetcher.formData
    ? fetcher.formData.get("favorite") === "true"
    : contact.favorite;

  return (
    <fetcher.Form method="post">
      <button
        aria-label={
          favorite
            ? "Remove from favorites"
            : "Add to favorites"
        }
        name="favorite"
        value={favorite ? "false" : "true"}
      >
        {favorite ? "★" : "☆"}
      </button>
    </fetcher.Form>
  );
}
```

Now the star _immediately_ changes to the new state when you click it.

# Upgrading from v6

<docs-info>

React Router v7 requires the following minimum versions:

- `node@20`
- `react@18`
- `react-dom@18`

</docs-info>

The v7 upgrade has no breaking changes if you have enabled all future flags. These flags allow you to update your app one change at a time. We highly recommend you make a commit after each step and ship it instead of doing everything all at once.

## Update to latest v6.x

First update to the latest minor version of v6.x to have the latest future flags and console warnings.

👉 **Update to latest v6**

```shellscript nonumber
npm install react-router-dom@6
```

### v7_relativeSplatPath

**Background**

Changes the relative path matching and linking for multi-segment splats paths like `dashboard/*` (vs. just `*`). [View the CHANGELOG](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#futurev7_relativesplatpath) for more information.

👉 **Enable the flag**

Enabling the flag depends on the type of router:

```tsx
<BrowserRouter
  future={{
    v7_relativeSplatPath: true,
  }}
/>
```

```tsx
createBrowserRouter(routes, {
  future: {
    v7_relativeSplatPath: true,
  },
});
```

**Update your Code**

If you have any routes with a path + a splat like `<Route path="dashboard/*">` that have relative links like `<Link to="relative">` or `<Link to="../relative">` beneath them, you will need to update your code.

👉 **Split the `<Route>` into two**

Split any multi-segment splat `<Route>` into a parent route with the path and a child route with the splat:

```diff
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
-  <Route path="dashboard/*" element={<Dashboard />} />
+  <Route path="dashboard">
+    <Route path="*" element={<Dashboard />} />
+  </Route>
</Routes>

// or
createBrowserRouter([
  { path: "/", element: <Home /> },
  {
-    path: "dashboard/*",
-    element: <Dashboard />,
+    path: "dashboard",
+    children: [{ path: "*", element: <Dashboard /> }],
  },
]);
```

👉 **Update relative links**

Update any `<Link>` elements within that route tree to include the extra `..` relative segment to continue linking to the same place:

```diff
function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Dashboard</h2>
      <nav>
-        <Link to="/">Dashboard Home</Link>
-        <Link to="team">Team</Link>
-        <Link to="projects">Projects</Link>
+        <Link to="../">Dashboard Home</Link>
+        <Link to="../team">Team</Link>
+        <Link to="../projects">Projects</Link>
      </nav>

      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<DashboardHome />} />
        <Route path="team" element={<DashboardTeam />} />
        <Route
          path="projects"
          element={<DashboardProjects />}
        />
      </Routes>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### v7_startTransition

**Background**

This uses `React.useTransition` instead of `React.useState` for Router state updates. View the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#futurev7_starttransition) for more information.

👉 **Enable the flag**

```tsx
<BrowserRouter
  future={{
    v7_startTransition: true,
  }}
/>

// or
<RouterProvider
  future={{
    v7_startTransition: true,
  }}
/>
```

👉 **Update your Code**

You don't need to update anything unless you are using `React.lazy` _inside_ of a component.

Using `React.lazy` inside of a component is incompatible with `React.useTransition` (or other code that makes promises inside of components). Move `React.lazy` to the module scope and stop making promises inside of components. This is not a limitation of React Router but rather incorrect usage of React.

### v7_fetcherPersist

<docs-warning>If you are not using a `<RouterProvider>` you can skip this</docs-warning>

**Background**

The fetcher lifecycle is now based on when it returns to an idle state rather than when its owner component unmounts: [View the CHANGELOG](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#persistence-future-flag-futurev7_fetcherpersist) for more information.

**Enable the Flag**

```tsx
createBrowserRouter(routes, {
  future: {
    v7_fetcherPersist: true,
  },
});
```

**Update your Code**

It's unlikely to affect your app. You may want to check any usage of `useFetchers` as they may persist longer than they did before. Depending on what you're doing, you may render something longer than before.

### v7_normalizeFormMethod

<docs-warning>If you are not using a `<RouterProvider>` you can skip this</docs-warning>

This normalizes `formMethod` fields as uppercase HTTP methods to align with the `fetch()` behavior. [View the CHANGELOG](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#futurev7_normalizeformmethod) for more information.

👉 **Enable the Flag**

```tsx
createBrowserRouter(routes, {
  future: {
    v7_normalizeFormMethod: true,
  },
});
```

**Update your Code**

If any of your code is checking for lowercase HTTP methods, you will need to update it to check for uppercase HTTP methods (or call `toLowerCase()` on it).

👉 **Compare `formMethod` to UPPERCASE**

```diff
-useNavigation().formMethod === "post"
-useFetcher().formMethod === "get";
+useNavigation().formMethod === "POST"
+useFetcher().formMethod === "GET";
```

### v7_partialHydration

<docs-warning>If you are not using a `<RouterProvider>` you can skip this</docs-warning>

This enables partial hydration of a data router which is primarily used for SSR frameworks, but it is also useful if you are using `lazy` to load your route modules. It's unlikely you need to worry about this, just turn the flag on. [View the CHANGELOG](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#partial-hydration) for more information.

👉 **Enable the Flag**

```tsx
createBrowserRouter(routes, {
  future: {
    v7_partialHydration: true,
  },
});
```

**Update your Code**

With partial hydration, you need to provide a `HydrateFallback` component to render during initial hydration. Additionally, if you were using `fallbackElement` before, you need to remove it as it is now deprecated. In most cases, you will want to reuse the `fallbackElement` as the `HydrateFallback`.

👉 **Replace `fallbackElement` with `HydrateFallback`**

```diff
const router = createBrowserRouter(
  [
    {
      path: "/",
      Component: Layout,
+      HydrateFallback: Fallback,
      // or
+      hydrateFallbackElement: <Fallback />,
      children: [],
    },
  ],
);


<RouterProvider
  router={router}
-  fallbackElement={<Fallback />}
/>
```

### v7_skipActionErrorRevalidation

<docs-warning>If you are not using a `createBrowserRouter` you can skip this</docs-warning>

When this flag is enabled, loaders will no longer revalidate by default after an action throws/returns a `Response` with a `4xx`/`5xx` status code. You may opt-into revalidation in these scenarios via `shouldRevalidate` and the `actionStatus` parameter.

👉 **Enable the Flag**

```tsx
createBrowserRouter(routes, {
  future: {
    v7_skipActionErrorRevalidation: true,
  },
});
```

**Update your Code**

In most cases, you probably won't have to make changes to your app code. Usually, if an action errors, it's unlikely data was mutated and needs revalidation. If any of your code _does_ mutate data in action error scenarios you have 2 options:

👉 **Option 1: Change the `action` to avoid mutations in error scenarios**

```js
// Before
async function action() {
  await mutateSomeData();
  if (detectError()) {
    throw new Response(error, { status: 400 });
  }
  await mutateOtherData();
  // ...
}

// After
async function action() {
  if (detectError()) {
    throw new Response(error, { status: 400 });
  }
  // All data is now mutated after validations
  await mutateSomeData();
  await mutateOtherData();
  // ...
}
```

👉 **Option 2: Opt-into revalidation via `shouldRevalidate` and `actionStatus`**

```js
async function action() {
  await mutateSomeData();
  if (detectError()) {
    throw new Response(error, { status: 400 });
  }
  await mutateOtherData();
}

async function loader() { ... }

function shouldRevalidate({ actionStatus, defaultShouldRevalidate }) {
  if (actionStatus != null && actionStatus >= 400) {
    // Revalidate this loader when actions return a 4xx/5xx status
    return true;
  }
  return defaultShouldRevalidate;
}
```

## Deprecations

The `json` and `defer` methods are deprecated in favor of returning raw objects.

```diff
async function loader() {
- return json({ data });
+ return { data };
```

If you were using `json` to serialize your data to JSON, you can use the native [Response.json()][response-json] method instead.

## Upgrade to v7

Now that your app is caught up, you can simply update to v7 (theoretically!) without issue.

👉 **Install v7**

```shellscript nonumber
npm install react-router-dom@latest
```

👉 **Replace react-router-dom with react-router**

In v7 we no longer need `"react-router-dom"` as the packages have been simplified. You can import everything from `"react-router"`:

```shellscript nonumber
npm uninstall react-router-dom
npm install react-router@latest
```

Note you only need `"react-router"` in your package.json.

👉 **Update imports**

Now you should update your imports to use `react-router`:

```diff
-import { useLocation } from "react-router-dom";
+import { useLocation } from "react-router";
```

Instead of manually updating imports, you can use this command. Make sure your git working tree is clean though so you can revert if it doesn't work as expected.

```shellscript nonumber
find ./path/to/src \( -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" \) -type f -exec sed -i '' 's|from "react-router-dom"|from "react-router"|g' {} +
```

If you have GNU `sed` installed (most Linux distributions), use this command instead:

```shellscript nonumber
find ./path/to/src \( -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" \) -type f -exec sed -i 's|from "react-router-dom"|from "react-router"|g' {} +
```

👉 **Update DOM-specific imports**

`RouterProvider` and `HydratedRouter` come from a deep import because they depend on `"react-dom"`:

```diff
-import { RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";
+import { RouterProvider } from "react-router/dom";
```

Note you should use a top-level import for non-DOM contexts, such as Jest tests:

```diff
-import { RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";
+import { RouterProvider } from "react-router";
```

Congratulations, you're now on v7!

# Future Flags and Deprecations

This guide walks you through the process of adopting future flags in your React Router app. By following this strategy, you will be able to upgrade to the next major version of React Router with minimal changes. To read more about future flags see [API Development Strategy](../community/api-development-strategy).

We highly recommend you make a commit after each step and ship it instead of doing everything all at once. Most flags can be adopted in any order, with exceptions noted below.

# Framework Adoption from RouterProvider

If you are not using `<RouterProvider>` please see [Framework Adoption from Component Routes][upgrade-component-routes] instead.

The React Router Vite plugin adds framework features to React Router. This guide will help you adopt the plugin in your app. If you run into any issues, please reach out for help on [Twitter](https://x.com/remix_run) or [Discord](https://rmx.as/discord).

## Features

The Vite plugin adds:

- Route loaders, actions, and automatic data revalidation
- Typesafe Routes Modules
- Automatic route code-splitting
- Automatic scroll restoration across navigations
- Optional Static pre-rendering
- Optional Server rendering

The initial setup requires the most work. However, once complete, you can adopt new features incrementally.

## Prerequisites

To use the Vite plugin, your project requires:

- Node.js 20+ (if using Node as your runtime)
- Vite 5+

## 1. Move route definitions into route modules

The React Router Vite plugin renders its own `RouterProvider`, so you can't render an existing `RouterProvider` within it. Instead, you will need to format all of your route definitions to match the [Route Module API][route-modules].

This step will take the longest, however there are several benefits to doing this regardless of adopting the React Router Vite plugin:

- Route modules will be lazy loaded, decreasing the initial bundle size of your app
- Route definitions will be uniform, simplifying your app's architecture
- Moving to route modules is incremental, you can migrate one route at a time

**👉 Move your route definitions into route modules**

Export each piece of your route definition as a separate named export, following the [Route Module API][route-modules].

```tsx filename=src/routes/about.tsx
export async function clientLoader() {
  return {
    title: "About",
  };
}

export default function About() {
  let data = useLoaderData();
  return <div>{data.title}</div>;
}

// clientAction, ErrorBoundary, etc.
```

**👉 Create a convert function**

Create a helper function to convert route module definitions into the format expected by your data router:

```tsx filename=src/main.tsx
function convert(m: any) {
  let {
    clientLoader,
    clientAction,
    default: Component,
    ...rest
  } = m;
  return {
    ...rest,
    loader: clientLoader,
    action: clientAction,
    Component,
  };
}
```

**👉 Lazy load and convert your route modules**

Instead of importing your route modules directly, lazy load and convert them to the format expected by your data router.

Not only does your route definition now conform to the Route Module API, but you also get the benefits of code-splitting your routes.

```diff filename=src/main.tsx
let router = createBrowserRouter([
  // ... other routes
  {
    path: "about",
-   loader: aboutLoader,
-   Component: About,
+   lazy: () => import("./routes/about").then(convert),
  },
  // ... other routes
]);
```

Repeat this process for each route in your app.

## 2. Install the Vite plugin

Once all of your route definitions are converted to route modules, you can adopt the React Router Vite plugin.

**👉 Install the React Router Vite plugin**

```shellscript nonumber
npm install -D @react-router/dev
```

**👉 Install a runtime adapter**

We will assume you are using Node as your runtime.

```shellscript nonumber
npm install @react-router/node
```

**👉 Swap out the React plugin for React Router**

```diff filename=vite.config.ts
-import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
+import { reactRouter } from "@react-router/dev/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";


export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
-    react()
+    reactRouter()
  ],
});
```

## 3. Add the React Router config

**👉 Create a `react-router.config.ts` file**

Add the following to the root of your project. In this config you can tell React Router about your project, like where to find the app directory and to not use SSR (server-side rendering) for now.

```shellscript nonumber
touch react-router.config.ts
```

```ts filename=react-router.config.ts
import type { Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";

export default {
  appDirectory: "src",
  ssr: false,
} satisfies Config;
```

## 4. Add the Root entry point

In a typical Vite app, the `index.html` file is the entry point for bundling. The React Router Vite plugin moves the entry point to a `root.tsx` file so you can use React to render the shell of your app instead of static HTML, and eventually upgrade to Server Rendering if you want.

**👉 Move your existing `index.html` to `root.tsx`**

For example, if your current `index.html` looks like this:

```html filename=index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta
      name="viewport"
      content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
    />
    <title>My App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

You would move that markup into `src/root.tsx` and delete `index.html`:

```shellscript nonumber
touch src/root.tsx
```

```tsx filename=src/root.tsx
import {
  Links,
  Meta,
  Outlet,
  Scripts,
  ScrollRestoration,
} from "react-router";

export function Layout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charSet="UTF-8" />
        <meta
          name="viewport"
          content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
        />
        <title>My App</title>
        <Meta />
        <Links />
      </head>
      <body>
        {children}
        <ScrollRestoration />
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

export default function Root() {
  return <Outlet />;
}
```

**👉 Move everything above `RouterProvider` to `root.tsx`**

Any global styles, context providers, etc. should be moved into `root.tsx` so they can be shared across all routes.

For example, if your `App.tsx` looks like this:

```tsx filename=src/App.tsx
import "./index.css";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <OtherProviders>
      <AppLayout>
        <RouterProvider router={router} />
      </AppLayout>
    </OtherProviders>
  );
}
```

You would move everything above the `RouterProvider` into `root.tsx`.

```diff filename=src/root.tsx
+import "./index.css";

// ... other imports and Layout

export default function Root() {
  return (
+   <OtherProviders>
+     <AppLayout>
        <Outlet />
+     </AppLayout>
+   </OtherProviders>
  );
}
```

## 5. Add client entry module (optional)

In the typical Vite app the `index.html` file points to `src/main.tsx` as the client entry point. React Router uses a file named `src/entry.client.tsx` instead.

If no `entry.client.tsx` exists, the React Router Vite plugin will use a default, hidden one.

**👉 Make `src/entry.client.tsx` your entry point**

If your current `src/main.tsx` looks like this:

```tsx filename=src/main.tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router";
import App from "./App";

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  // ... route definitions
]);

ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById("root")!
).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />;
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

You would rename it to `entry.client.tsx` and change it to this:

```tsx filename=src/entry.client.tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { HydratedRouter } from "react-router/dom";

ReactDOM.hydrateRoot(
  document,
  <React.StrictMode>
    <HydratedRouter />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

- Use `hydrateRoot` instead of `createRoot`
- Render a `<HydratedRouter>` instead of your `<App/>` component
- Note: We are no longer creating the routes and manually passing them to `<RouterProvider />`. We will migrate our route definitions in the next step.

## 6. Migrate your routes

The React Router Vite plugin uses a `routes.ts` file to configure your routes. The format will be pretty similar to the definitions of your data router.

**👉 Move definitions to a `routes.ts` file**

```shellscript nonumber
touch src/routes.ts src/catchall.tsx
```

Move your route definitions to `routes.ts`. Note that the schemas don't match exactly, so you will get type errors; we'll fix this next.

```diff filename=src/routes.ts
+import type { RouteConfig } from "@react-router/dev/routes";

-const router = createBrowserRouter([
+export default [
  {
    path: "/",
    lazy: () => import("./routes/layout").then(convert),
    children: [
      {
        index: true,
        lazy: () => import("./routes/home").then(convert),
      },
      {
        path: "about",
        lazy: () => import("./routes/about").then(convert),
      },
      {
        path: "todos",
        lazy: () => import("./routes/todos").then(convert),
        children: [
          {
            path: ":id",
            lazy: () =>
              import("./routes/todo").then(convert),
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
-]);
+] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

**👉 Replace the `lazy` loader with a `file` loader**

```diff filename=src/routes.ts
export default [
  {
    path: "/",
-   lazy: () => import("./routes/layout").then(convert),
+   file: "./routes/layout.tsx",
    children: [
      {
        index: true,
-       lazy: () => import("./routes/home").then(convert),
+       file: "./routes/home.tsx",
      },
      {
        path: "about",
-       lazy: () => import("./routes/about").then(convert),
+       file: "./routes/about.tsx",
      },
      {
        path: "todos",
-       lazy: () => import("./routes/todos").then(convert),
+       file: "./routes/todos.tsx",
        children: [
          {
            path: ":id",
-           lazy: () => import("./routes/todo").then(convert),
+           file: "./routes/todo.tsx",
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

[View our guide on configuring routes][configuring-routes] to learn more about the `routes.ts` file and helper functions to further simplify the route definitions.

## 7. Boot the app

At this point you should be fully migrated to the React Router Vite plugin. Go ahead and update your `dev` script and run the app to make sure everything is working.

**👉 Add `dev` script and run the app**

```json filename=package.json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "react-router dev"
}
```

Now make sure you can boot your app at this point before moving on:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

You will probably want to add `.react-router/` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid tracking unnecessary files in your repository.

```txt
.react-router/
```

You can checkout [Type Safety][type-safety] to learn how to fully setup and use autogenerated type safety for params, loader data, and more.

## Enable SSR and/or Pre-rendering

If you want to enable server rendering and static pre-rendering, you can do so with the `ssr` and `prerender` options in the bundler plugin. For SSR you'll need to also deploy the server build to a server.

```ts filename=react-router.config.ts
import type { Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";

export default {
  ssr: true,
  async prerender() {
    return ["/", "/about", "/contact"];
  },
} satisfies Config;
```

# Framework Adoption from Component Routes

If you are using `<RouterProvider>` please see [Framework Adoption from RouterProvider][upgrade-router-provider] instead.

If you are using `<Routes>` this is the right place.

The React Router Vite plugin adds framework features to React Router. This guide will help you adopt the plugin in your app. If you run into any issues, please reach out for help on [Twitter](https://x.com/remix_run) or [Discord](https://rmx.as/discord).

## Features

The Vite plugin adds:

- Route loaders, actions, and automatic data revalidation
- Typesafe Routes Modules
- Automatic route code-splitting
- Automatic scroll restoration across navigations
- Optional Static pre-rendering
- Optional Server rendering

The initial setup requires the most work. However, once complete, you can adopt new features incrementally, one route at a time.

## Prerequisites

To use the Vite plugin, your project requires:

- Node.js 20+ (if using Node as your runtime)
- Vite 5+

## 1. Install the Vite plugin

**👉 Install the React Router Vite plugin**

```shellscript nonumber
npm install -D @react-router/dev
```

**👉 Install a runtime adapter**

We will assume you are using Node as your runtime.

```shellscript nonumber
npm install @react-router/node
```

**👉 Swap out the React plugin for React Router.**

```diff filename=vite.config.ts
-import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
+import { reactRouter } from "@react-router/dev/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";


export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
-    react()
+    reactRouter()
  ],
});
```

## 2. Add the React Router config

**👉 Create a `react-router.config.ts` file**

Add the following to the root of your project. In this config you can tell React Router about your project, like where to find the app directory and to not use SSR (server-side rendering) for now.

```shellscript nonumber
touch react-router.config.ts
```

```ts filename=react-router.config.ts
import type { Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";

export default {
  appDirectory: "src",
  ssr: false,
} satisfies Config;
```

**👉 Move your existing `index.html` to `root.tsx`**

For example, if your current `index.html` looks like this:

```html filename=index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta
      name="viewport"
      content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
    />
    <title>My App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

You would move that markup into `src/root.tsx` and delete `index.html`:

```shellscript nonumber
touch src/root.tsx
```

```tsx filename=src/root.tsx
import {
  Links,
  Meta,
  Outlet,
  Scripts,
  ScrollRestoration,
} from "react-router";

export function Layout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charSet="UTF-8" />
        <meta
          name="viewport"
          content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
        />
        <title>My App</title>
        <Meta />
        <Links />
      </head>
      <body>
        {children}
        <ScrollRestoration />
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

export default function Root() {
  return <Outlet />;
}
```

## 4. Add client entry module

In the typical Vite app the `index.html` file points to `src/main.tsx` as the client entry point. React Router uses a file named `src/entry.client.tsx` instead.

**👉 Make `src/entry.client.tsx` your entry point**

If your current `src/main.tsx` looks like this:

```tsx filename=src/main.tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById("root")!
).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

You would rename it to `entry.client.tsx` and change it to this:

```tsx filename=src/entry.client.tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { HydratedRouter } from "react-router/dom";
import "./index.css";

ReactDOM.hydrateRoot(
  document,
  <React.StrictMode>
    <HydratedRouter />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

- Use `hydrateRoot` instead of `createRoot`
- Render a `<HydratedRouter>` instead of your `<App/>` component
- Note: we stopped rendering the `<App/>` component. We'll bring it back in a later step, but first we want to get the app to boot with the new entry point.

## 5. Shuffle stuff around

Between `root.tsx` and `entry.client.tsx`, you may want to shuffle some stuff around between them.

In general:

- `root.tsx` contains any rendering things like context providers, layouts, styles, etc.
- `entry.client.tsx` should be as minimal as possible
- Remember to _not_ try to render your existing `<App/>` component yet, we'll do that in a later step

Note that your `root.tsx` file will be statically generated and served as the entry point of your app, so just that module will need to be compatible with server rendering. This is where most of your trouble will come.

## 6. Set up your routes

The React Router Vite plugin uses a `routes.ts` file to configure your routes. For now we'll add a simple catchall route to get things going.

**👉 Set up a `catchall.tsx` route**

```shellscript nonumber
touch src/routes.ts src/catchall.tsx
```

```ts filename=src/routes.ts
import {
  type RouteConfig,
  route,
} from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
  // * matches all URLs, the ? makes it optional so it will match / as well
  route("*?", "catchall.tsx"),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

**👉 Render a placeholder route**

Eventually we'll replace this with our original `App` component, but for now we'll just render something simple to make sure we can boot the app.

```tsx filename=src/catchall.tsx
export default function Component() {
  return <div>Hello, world!</div>;
}
```

[View our guide on configuring routes][configuring-routes] to learn more about the `routes.ts` file.

## 7. Boot the app

At this point you should be able to to boot the app and see the root layout.

**👉 Add `dev` script and run the app**

```json filename=package.json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "react-router dev"
}
```

Now make sure you can boot your app at this point before moving on:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

You will probably want to add `.react-router/` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid tracking unnecessary files in your repository.

```txt
.react-router/
```

You can check out [Type Safety][type-safety] to learn how to fully set up and use autogenerated type safety for params, loader data, and more.

## 8. Render your app

To get back to rendering your app, we'll update the "catchall" route we set up earlier that matches all URLs so that your existing `<Routes>` get a chance to render.

**👉 Update the catchall route to render your app**

```tsx filename=src/catchall.tsx
import App from "./App";

export default function Component() {
  return <App />;
}
```

Your app should be back on the screen and working as usual!

## 9. Migrate a route to a Route Module

You can now incrementally migrate your routes to route modules.

Given an existing route like this:

```tsx filename=src/App.tsx
// ...
import About from "./containers/About";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
    </Routes>
  );
}
```

**👉 Add the route definition to `routes.ts`**

```tsx filename=src/routes.ts
import {
  type RouteConfig,
  route,
} from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
  route("/about", "./pages/about.tsx"),
  route("*?", "catchall.tsx"),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

**👉 Add the route module**

Edit the route module to use the [Route Module API][route-modules]:

```tsx filename=src/pages/about.tsx
export async function clientLoader() {
  // you can now fetch data here
  return {
    title: "About page",
  };
}

export default function Component({ loaderData }) {
  return <h1>{loaderData.title}</h1>;
}
```

See [Type Safety][type-safety] to set up autogenerated type safety for params, loader data, and more.

The first few routes you migrate are the hardest because you often have to access various abstractions a bit differently than before (like in a loader instead of from a hook or context). But once the trickiest bits get dealt with, you get into an incremental groove.

## Enable SSR and/or Pre-rendering

If you want to enable server rendering and static pre-rendering, you can do so with the `ssr` and `prerender` options in the bundler plugin. For SSR you'll need to also deploy the server build to a server.

```ts filename=react-router.config.ts
import type { Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";

export default {
  ssr: true,
  async prerender() {
    return ["/", "/about", "/contact"];
  },
} satisfies Config;
```

React Router v7 is the next major version of Remix after v2 (see our ["Incremental Path to React 19" blog post][incremental-path-to-react-19] for more information).

If you have enabled all [Remix v2 future flags][v2-future-flags], upgrading from Remix v2 to React Router v7 mainly involves updating dependencies.

<docs-info>

The majority of steps 2-8 can be automatically updated using a [codemod][codemod] created by community member [James Restall][jrestall].

</docs-info>

## 1. Adopt future flags

**👉 Adopt future flags**

Adopt all existing [future flags][v2-future-flags] in your Remix v2 application.

## 2. Update dependencies

Most of the "shared" APIs that used to be re-exported through the runtime-specific packages (`@remix-run/node`, `@remix-run/cloudflare`, etc.) have all been collapsed into `react-router` in v7. So instead of importing from `@react-router/node` or `@react-router/cloudflare`, you'll import those directly from `react-router`.

```diff
-import { redirect } from "@remix-run/node";
+import { redirect } from "react-router";
```

The only APIs you should be importing from the runtime-specific packages in v7 are APIs that are specific to that runtime, such as `createFileSessionStorage` for Node and `createWorkersKVSessionStorage` for Cloudflare.

**👉 Run the codemod (automated)**

You can automatically update your packages and imports with the following [codemod][codemod]. This codemod updates all of your packages and imports. Be sure to commit any pending changes before running the codemod, in case you need to revert.

```shellscript nonumber
npx codemod remix/2/react-router/upgrade
```

**👉 Install the new dependencies**

After the codemod updates your dependencies, you need to install the dependencies to remove Remix packages and add the new React Router packages.

```shellscript nonumber
npm install
```

**👉 Update your dependencies (manual)**

If you prefer not to use the codemod, you can manually update your dependencies.

</details>

## 3. Change `scripts` in `package.json`

<docs-info>

If you used the codemod you can skip this step as it was automatically completed.

</docs-info>

**👉 Update the scripts in your `package.json`**

| Script      | Remix v2                            |     | React Router v7                            |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | --- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `dev`       | `remix vite:dev`                    | ➡️  | `react-router dev`                         |
| `build`     | `remix vite:build`                  | ➡️  | `react-router build`                       |
| `start`     | `remix-serve build/server/index.js` | ➡️  | `react-router-serve build/server/index.js` |
| `typecheck` | `tsc`                               | ➡️  | `react-router typegen && tsc`              |

## 4. Add a `routes.ts` file

<docs-info>

If you used the codemod _and_ Remix v2 `v3_routeConfig` flag, you can skip this step as it was automatically completed.

</docs-info>

In React Router v7 you define your routes using the `app/routes.ts` file. View the [routing documentation][routing] for more information.

**👉 Update dependencies (if using Remix v2 `v3_routeConfig` flag)**

```diff
// app/routes.ts
-import { type RouteConfig } from "@remix-run/route-config";
-import { flatRoutes } from "@remix-run/fs-routes";
-import { remixRoutesOptionAdapter } from "@remix-run/routes-option-adapter";
+import { type RouteConfig } from "@react-router/dev/routes";
+import { flatRoutes } from "@react-router/fs-routes";
+import { remixRoutesOptionAdapter } from "@react-router/remix-routes-option-adapter";

export default [
  // however your routes are defined
] satisfies RouteConfig;

```

**👉 Add a `routes.ts` file (if _not_ using Remix v2 `v3_routeConfig` flag)**

```shellscript nonumber
touch app/routes.ts
```

For backwards-compatibility and for folks who prefer [file-based conventions][fs-routing], you can opt-into the same "flat routes" convention you are using in Remix v2 via the new `@react-router/fs-routes` package:

```ts filename=app/routes.ts
import { type RouteConfig } from "@react-router/dev/routes";
import { flatRoutes } from "@react-router/fs-routes";

export default flatRoutes() satisfies RouteConfig;
```

Or, if you were using the `routes` option to define config-based routes:

```ts filename=app/routes.ts
import { type RouteConfig } from "@react-router/dev/routes";
import { remixRoutesOptionAdapter } from "@react-router/remix-routes-option-adapter";

export default remixRoutesOptionAdapter((defineRoutes) => {
  return defineRoutes((route) => {
    route("/", "home/route.tsx", { index: true });
    route("about", "about/route.tsx");
    route("", "concerts/layout.tsx", () => {
      route("trending", "concerts/trending.tsx");
      route(":city", "concerts/city.tsx");
    });
  });
}) satisfies RouteConfig;
```

If you were using the `routes` option in your `vite.config.ts`, be sure to remove it.

```diff
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    remix({
      ssr: true,
-     ignoredRouteFiles: ['**/*'],
-     routes(defineRoutes) {
-       return defineRoutes((route) => {
-         route("/somewhere/cool/*", "catchall.tsx");
-       });
-     },
    })
    tsconfigPaths(),
  ],
});
```

## 5. Add a React Router config

**👉 Add `react-router.config.ts` your project**

The config that was previously passed to the `remix` plugin in `vite.config.ts` is now exported from `react-router.config.ts`.

Note: At this point you should remove the v3 future flags you added in step 1.

```shellscript nonumber
touch react-router.config.ts
```

```diff
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
-   remix({
-     ssr: true,
-     future: {/* all the v3 flags */}
-   }),
+   reactRouter(),
    tsconfigPaths(),
  ],
});

// react-router.config.ts
+import type { Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";
+export default {
+  ssr: true,
+} satisfies Config;
```

## 6. Add React Router plugin to `vite.config`

<docs-info>

If you used the codemod you can skip this step as it was automatically completed.

</docs-info>

**👉 Add `reactRouter` plugin to `vite.config`**

Change `vite.config.ts` to import and use the new `reactRouter` plugin from `@react-router/dev/vite`:

```diff
-import { vitePlugin as remix } from "@remix-run/dev";
+import { reactRouter } from "@react-router/dev/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import tsconfigPaths from "vite-tsconfig-paths";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
-   remix(),
+   reactRouter(),
    tsconfigPaths(),
  ],
});
```

## 7. Enable type safety

<docs-info>

If you are not using TypeScript, you can skip this step.

</docs-info>

React Router automatically generates types for your route modules into a `.react-router/` directory at the root of your app. This directory is fully managed by React Router and should be gitignore'd. Learn more about the [new type safety features][type-safety].

**👉 Add `.react-router/` to `.gitignore`**

```txt
.react-router/
```

**👉 Update `tsconfig.json`**

Update the `types` field in your `tsconfig.json` to include:

- `.react-router/types/**/*` path in the `include` field
- The appropriate `@react-router/*` package in the `types` field
- `rootDirs` for simplified relative imports

```diff
{
  "include": [
    /* ... */
+   ".react-router/types/**/*"
  ],
  "compilerOptions": {
-   "types": ["@remix-run/node", "vite/client"],
+   "types": ["@react-router/node", "vite/client"],
    /* ... */
+   "rootDirs": [".", "./.react-router/types"]
  }
}
```

## 8. Rename components in entry files

<docs-info>

If you used the codemod you can skip this step as it was automatically completed.

</docs-info>

If you have an `entry.server.tsx` and/or an `entry.client.tsx` file in your application, you will need to update the main components in these files:

```diff filename=app/entry.server.tsx
-import { RemixServer } from "@remix-run/react";
+import { ServerRouter } from "react-router";

-<RemixServer context={remixContext} url={request.url} />,
+<ServerRouter context={remixContext} url={request.url} />,
```

```diff filename=app/entry.client.tsx
-import { RemixBrowser } from "@remix-run/react";
+import { HydratedRouter } from "react-router/dom";

hydrateRoot(
  document,
  <StrictMode>
-   <RemixBrowser />
+   <HydratedRouter />
  </StrictMode>,
);
```

## 9. Update types for `AppLoadContext`

<docs-info>

If you were using `remix-serve` you can skip this step. This is only applicable if you were using a custom server in Remix v2.

</docs-info>

Since React Router can be used as both a React framework _and_ a stand-alone routing library, the `context` argument for `LoaderFunctionArgs` and `ActionFunctionArgs` is now optional and typed as `any` by default. You can register types for your load context to get type safety for your loaders and actions.

👉 **Register types for your load context**

Before you migrate to the new `Route.LoaderArgs` and `Route.ActionArgs` types, you can temporarily augment `LoaderFunctionArgs` and `ActionFunctionArgs` with your load context type to ease migration.

```ts filename=app/env.ts
declare module "react-router" {
  // Your AppLoadContext used in v2
  interface AppLoadContext {
    whatever: string;
  }

  // TODO: remove this once we've migrated to `Route.LoaderArgs` instead for our loaders
  interface LoaderFunctionArgs {
    context: AppLoadContext;
  }

  // TODO: remove this once we've migrated to `Route.ActionArgs` instead for our actions
  interface ActionFunctionArgs {
    context: AppLoadContext;
  }
}

export {}; // necessary for TS to treat this as a module
```

<docs-info>

Using `declare module` to register types is a standard TypeScript technique called [module augmentation][ts-module-augmentation].
You can do this in any TypeScript file covered by your `tsconfig.json`'s `include` field, but we recommend a dedicated `env.ts` within your app directory.

</docs-info>

👉 **Use the new types**

Once you adopt the [new type generation][type-safety], you can remove the `LoaderFunctionArgs`/`ActionFunctionArgs` augmentations and use the `context` argument from [`Route.LoaderArgs`][server-loaders] and [`Route.ActionArgs`][server-actions] instead.

```ts filename=app/env.ts
declare module "react-router" {
  // Your AppLoadContext used in v2
  interface AppLoadContext {
    whatever: string;
  }
}

export {}; // necessary for TS to treat this as a module
```

```ts filename=app/routes/my-route.tsx
import type { Route } from "./+types/my-route";

export function loader({ context }: Route.LoaderArgs) {}
// { whatever: string }  ^^^^^^^

export function action({ context }: Route.ActionArgs) {}
// { whatever: string }  ^^^^^^^
```

Congratulations! You are now on React Router v7. Go ahead and run your application to make sure everything is working as expected.

title: API Development Strategy
---

# API Development Strategy

React Router is foundational to your application. We want to make sure that upgrading to new major versions is as smooth as possible while still allowing us to adjust and enhance the behavior and API as the React ecosystem advances.

Our strategy and motivations are discussed in more detail in our [Future Flags][future-flags-blog-post] blog post.

## Future Flags

When an API changes in a breaking way, it is introduced in a future flag. This allows you to opt-in to one change a time before it becomes the default in the next major version.

- Without enabling the future flag, nothing changes about your app
- Enabling the flag changes the behavior for that feature

All current future flags are documented in the [Future Flags Guide](../upgrading/future) to help you stay up-to-date.

## Unstable Flags

Unstable flags are for features still being designed and developed and made available to our users to help us get it right.

Unstable flags are not recommended for production:

- they will change without warning and without upgrade paths
- they will have bugs
- they aren't documented
- they may be scrapped completely

When you opt-in to an unstable flag you are becoming a contributor to the project, rather than a user. We appreciate your help, but please be aware of the new role!

Because unstable flags are experimental and not guaranteed to stick around, we ship them in SemVer patch releases because they're not new _stable_/_documented_ APIs. When an unstable flag stabilizes into a Future Flag, that will be released in a SemVer minor release and will be properly documented and added to the [Future Flags Guide](../upgrading/future).

To learn about current unstable flags, keep an eye on the [CHANGELOG](../start/changelog).

### Example New Feature Flow

The decision flow for a new feature looks something like this (note this diagram is in relation to Remix v1/v2 but applies to React Router v6/v7 as well):

# Contributing to React Router

Thanks for contributing, you rock!

When it comes to open source, there are many different kinds of contributions that can be made, all of which are valuable. Here are a few guidelines that should help you as you prepare your contribution.

## Setup

Before you can contribute to the codebase, you will need to fork the repo. This will look a bit different depending on what type of contribution you are making:

- All new features, bug-fixes, or **anything that touches `react-router` code** should be branched off of and merged into the `dev` branch
- Changes that only touch documentation can be branched off of and merged into the `main` branch

The following steps will get you set up to contribute changes to this repo:

1. Fork the repo (click the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button at the top right of [this page](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router))
2. Clone your fork locally

   ```bash
   # in a terminal, cd to parent directory where you want your clone to be, then
   git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/react-router.git
   cd react-router

   # if you are making *any* code changes, make sure to checkout the dev branch
   git checkout dev
   ```

3. Install dependencies and build. React Router uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io), so you should too. If you install using `npm`, unnecessary `package-lock.json` files will be generated.

## Think You Found a Bug?

Please conform to the issue template and provide a clear path to reproduction with a code example. Best is a pull request with a [failing test](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/dev/integration/bug-report-test.ts). Next best is a link to [StackBlitz](https://reactrouter.com/new) or repository that illustrates the bug.

## Adding an Example?

Examples can be added directly to the main branch. Create a branch off of your local clone of main. Once you've finished, create a pull request and outline your example.

## Proposing New or Changed API?

Please provide thoughtful comments and some sample code that show what you'd like to do with React Router in your app. It helps the conversation if you can show us how you're limited by the current API first before jumping to a conclusion about what needs to be changed and/or added.

We have learned by experience that small APIs are usually better, so we may be a little reluctant to add something new unless there's an obvious limitation with the current API. That being said, we are always anxious to hear about cases that we just haven't considered before, so please don't be shy! :)

## Issue Not Getting Attention?

If you need a bug fixed and nobody is fixing it, your best bet is to provide a fix for it and make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). Open source code belongs to all of us, and it's all of our responsibility to push it forward.

## Making a Pull Request?

Pull requests need only the approval of two or more collaborators to be merged; when the PR author is a collaborator, that counts as one.

<docs-warning>When creating the PR in GitHub, make sure that you set the base to the correct branch. If you are submitting a PR that touches any code, this should be the `dev` branch. You set the base in GitHub when authoring the PR with the dropdown below the "Compare changes" heading: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/remix-run/react-router/main/static/base-branch.png" alt="" width="460" height="350" /></docs-warning>

### Tests

All commits that fix bugs or add features need a test.

<docs-error>Do not merge code without tests!</docs-error>

### Docs + Examples

All commits that change or add to the API must be done in a pull request that also updates all relevant examples and docs.

Documentation is located in the `docs` directory. Once changes make their way into the `main` branch, they will automatically be published to the docs site.

If you want to preview how the changes will look on the docs site, clone the [`react-router-website` repository](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router-website) and follow the instructions in `README.md` to view your changes locally.

## Development

### Packages

React Router uses a monorepo to host code for multiple packages. These packages live in the `packages` directory.

We use [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces/) to manage installation of dependencies and running various scripts. To get everything installed, make sure you have [pnpm installed](https://pnpm.io/installation), and then run `pnpm install` from the repo root.

### Building

Calling `pnpm build` from the root directory will run the build, which should take only a few seconds. It's important to build all the packages together because the individual packages have dependencies on one another.

### Testing

Before running the tests, you need to run a build. After you build, running `pnpm test` from the root directory will run **every** package's tests. If you want to run tests for a specific package, use `pnpm test --projects packages/<package-name>`:

```bash
# Test all packages
pnpm test

# Test only react-router-dom
pnpm test --projects packages/react-router-dom
```

## Repository Branching

This repo maintains separate branches for different purposes. They will look something like this:

```
- main   > the most recent release and current docs
- dev    > code under active development between stable releases
- v5     > the most recent code for a specific major release
```

There may be other branches for various features and experimentation, but all of the magic happens from these branches.

## New Releases

When it's time to cut a new release, we follow a process based on our branching strategy depending on the type of release.

### `react-router@next` Releases

We create experimental releases from the current state of the `dev` branch. They can be installed by using the `@next` tag:

```bash
pnpm add react-router-dom@next
# or
npm install react-router-dom@next
```

These releases will be automated as PRs are merged into the `dev` branch.

### Latest Major Releases

```bash
# Start from the dev branch.
git checkout dev

# Merge the main branch into dev to ensure that any hotfixes and
# docs updates are available in the release.
git merge main

# Create a new release branch from dev.
git checkout -b release/v6.1.0

# Create a new tag and update version references throughout the
# codebase.
pnpm run version [nextVersion]

# Push the release branch along with the new release tag.
git push origin release/v6.1.0 --follow-tags

# Wait for GitHub actions to run all tests. If the tests pass, the
# release is ready to go! Merge the release branch into main and dev.
git checkout main
git merge release/v6.1.0
git checkout dev
git merge release/v6.1.0

# The release branch can now be deleted.
git branch -D release/v6.1.0
git push origin --delete release/v6.1.0

# Now go to GitHub and create the release from the new tag. Let
# GitHub Actions take care of the rest!
```

### Hot-fix Releases

Sometimes we have a crucial bug that needs to be patched right away. If the bug affects the latest release, we can create a new version directly from `main` (or the relevant major release branch where the bug exists):

```bash
# From the main branch, make sure to run the build and all tests
# before creating a new release.
pnpm install && pnpm build && pnpm test

# Assuming the tests pass, create the release tag and update
# version references throughout the codebase.
pnpm run version [nextVersion]

# Push changes along with the new release tag.
git push origin main --follow-tags

# In GitHub, create the release from the new tag and it will be
# published via GitHub actions

# When the hot-fix is done, merge the changes into dev and clean
# up conflicts as needed.
git checkout dev
git merge main
git push origin dev
```

title: Markdown Elements
hidden: true

# Markdown Elements

This is for testing all the different kinds of markdown that can exist. Whenever I find a styling edge case that exists, I add it to this document. It’s my form of visual regression for all the different kinds of elements that need to be styled across different contexts.

## Headings

Headings at sizes 4, 5, and 6 are all treated equally. If we start writing prose that needs those headings, we should re-evaluate our lives.

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

## Tables

| Syntax | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Row 1  | Column 2    |
| Row 2  | Column 2    |
| Row 3  | Column 2    |

## Callouts

Callouts can be used with the `<docs-*>` elements. They are specifically for calling special attention to pieces of information outside the normal flow of the document.

There are three supported variations of these elements:

1. `<docs-info>` - For general callouts to bits of information.
2. `<docs-warning>` - For warning the read about something they should know.
3. `<docs-error>` - For telling the user they shouldn’t be doing something.

Examples:

<docs-info>`<Link to>` with a `..` behaves differently from a normal `<a href>` when the current URL ends with `/`. `<Link to>` ignores the trailing slash, and removes one URL segment for each `..`. But an `<a href>` value handles `..` differently when the current URL ends with `/` vs when it does not.</docs-info>

<docs-warning>`useMatches` only works with a data router like [`createBrowserRouter`][createbrowserrouter], since they know the full route tree up front and can provide all of the current matches. Additionally, `useMatches` will not match down into any descendant route trees since the router isn't aware of the descendant routes.</docs-warning>

<docs-error>Do not do this</docs-error>

<docs-info>The markup for this is kind of ugly, because (currently) these all have to be inside the `<docs-*>` element without any line breaks _but_ it is possible there could be an image inside these. <img src="https://picsum.photos/480/270" width="480" height="270" /></docs-info>

Note: maybe the semantics for these aren't quite right. There might be other nouns that make sense in the case of docs, like:

- `<docs-info>` could become `<docs-tip>`
- `<docs-warning>` could become `<docs-important>`
- `<docs-error>` could become `<docs-warning>` or `<docs-danger>`

## Blockquotes

This is a `<blockquote>` with multiple lines and styles in it:

> This is my quote.
>
> It can have [links]($link), **bold text**, _italic text_, and even `<code>`, all of which should be accounted for. Oh, and don't forget lists:
>
> - List item 1
> - List item 2
> - List item 3
>
> Unordered, or ordered:
>
> 1. List item
> 2. Another list item
> 3. Yet another list item

## Lists

This is a list of links, some of which are code:

- This is my first list item
- [This is my second list item that’s a link][$link]
- This is my third item that has `<code>` and [`<LinkedCode>` mixed with text][$link]

And don't forget about proper styling for `<a>` tags that don’t have an `href`: <a>like this link right here</a>.

And then there’s the `<dl>` lists:

<dl>
  <dt>React</dt>
  <dd>Respond or behave in a particular way in response to something</dd>
  <dt>Router</dt>
  <dd>A device that forwards data packets to the appropriate parts of a computer network.</dd>
  <dt>Library</dt>
  <dd>A building or room containing collections of books, periodicals, and sometimes films and recorded music for people to read, borrow, or refer to.</dd>
  <dd>A collection of programs and software packages made generally available, often loaded and stored on disk for immediate use.</dd>
</dl>

## Code

Normal code:

```tsx
<WhateverRouter initialEntries={["/events/123"]}>
  <Route path="/" element={<Root />} loader={rootLoader}>
    <Route
      path="events/:id"
      element={<Event />}
      loader={eventLoader}
    />
  </Route>
</WhateverRouter>
```

With multiple highlighted lines:

```tsx lines=[1-2,5]
<WhateverRouter initialEntries={["/events/123"]}>
  <Route path="/" element={<Root />} loader={rootLoader}>
    <Route
      path="events/:id"
      element={<Event />}
      loader={eventLoader}
    />
  </Route>
</WhateverRouter>
```

With a filename:

```tsx filename=src/main.jsx
<WhateverRouter initialEntries={["/events/123"]}>
  <Route path="/" element={<Root />} loader={rootLoader}>
    <Route
      path="events/:id"
      element={<Event />}
      loader={eventLoader}
    />
  </Route>
</WhateverRouter>
```

Bad code:

```tsx bad
<WhateverRouter initialEntries={["/events/123"]}>
  <Route path="/" element={<Root />} loader={rootLoader}>
    <Route
      path="events/:id"
      element={<Event />}
      loader={eventLoader}
    />
  </Route>
</WhateverRouter>
```

Bad code with highlighted lines and a filename:

```tsx filename=src/main.jsx bad lines=[2-5]
<WhateverRouter initialEntries={["/events/123"]}>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Root />} loader={rootLoader}>
      <Route
        path="events/:id"
        element={<Event />}
        loader={eventLoader}
      />
    </Route>
  </Routes>
</WhateverRouter>
```

Lines that overflow:

```html
<!-- Other HTML for your app goes here -->
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@>=16.8/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
```
